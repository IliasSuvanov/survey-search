This is expected to improve local development, local governance, and strengthen social cohesion. However, the empirical evidence for the third outcome is quite weak. This paper presents the findings of an impact evaluation research examining the extent the community driven development intervention implemented during 2014-2017 strengthened social cohesion in two regions in Kyrgyzstan. Our findings are that, on the one hand, the CDD project led to a sense of unity and cooperation and to a perception of improvements in local governance and educational services. On the other hand, the program had at best a weak effect on deep-trenched perceptions, attitudes and trust for closely related social groups and local institutions. We posit that these results obtained in part because the duration of the CDD interventions was rather short and the micro-projects were only realized in less than a half of villages in treatment sub-districts. It stands to reason that larger and longer CDD projects would have had larger impacts on social cohesion as well.","2018-10-29","2021-06-24 16:58:46","2021-06-24 16:59:04","2021-06-24 16:58:46","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiK2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\PZZY8LFF\papers.html","","","community-driven development; governance; household survey; impact evaluation; local development; post-conflict; social cohesion; theory of change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3807810","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence from Kyrgyzstan","AgEcon Search","","","","https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/288951","This paper examines the impact of the harsh 2012 winter on livestock herding households in Kyrgyzstan and identifies policy options to increase household resilience to such shocks. While existing studies mostly focus on rainfall shocks in tropical or dry climate areas, this analysis examines the exceptionally harsh winter that hit Kyrgyzstan in 2012, which resulted in the death of 25 000 animals. Using a unique household panel survey, merged with observed temperature data, the analysis finds that, on average, the negative effects of the winter shock on household welfare are significant and persistent over time, leading to a 5 percent and a 8 percent decrease in households' food consumption expenditure in the short- (2011'2013) and medium-run (2011'2016), respectively. When disaggregating by income quantiles, the evidence shows that negative impact is concentrated in the upper quantiles of the welfare distribution. Several policy options are identified as effective in mitigating the negative welfare impacts of the weather shock. First, supporting households to restock their herds following weather shocks is found to significantly improve medium-term welfare by 10 percent relative to those that did not restock. Restocking efforts can be addressed in a holistic manner that takes into account immediate household needs, while simultaneously building long-term resilience in the livestock sector. This may include mitigating animal losses through the development of local forage markets that increase the availability of winter forage, combined with efforts to improve the genetic pool of livestock species through breeding programmes that select for resiliency traits. Second, results show that households living in regions with higher access to public veterinary services had significantly better welfare outcomes following the winter shock. Improvements of veterinary services and strengthening community-based organizations focusing on livestock and pasture development may help herding households to cope with weather shocks.","2018-11-29","2021-06-24 16:54:52","2021-06-24 16:55:08","2021-06-24 16:54:52","","","","","","","How do extreme weather events affect livestock herders' welfare?","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","LiK2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\Z26W5M7G\288951.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3DSVRI8M\Conti et al. - 2018 - How do extreme weather events affect livestock her.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cross-sectional analysis of the performance of these indices against ones comprising only income and hours worked show no relationship between job quality and wellbeing in the latter case but a strong and positive relationship in the former.

Using a large longitudinal survey, we find that, among the ethnic majority (Kyrgyz), an increase in migrant remittances is associated with a higher likelihood and frequency of consuming alcohol, as well as an increase in the consumption of beer. Among ethnic Russians, the emigration of family members who do not send remittances back home is associated with an increased likelihood and frequency of alcohol consumption. We discuss possible mechanisms through which emigration and remittances may affect the alcohol consumption of those staying behind, including the relaxation of budget constraints and psychological distress. Overall, our findings suggest that the emigration of household members contribute to a greater alcohol consumption among those staying behind, and highlight the role of remittances and cultural background in understanding the nuances in this relationship.","2019-01-01","2021-06-24 16:36:59","2021-06-24 16:37:29","2021-06-24 16:36:59","40-48","","","221","","Social Science & Medicine","Emigration and alcohol consumption among migrant household members staying behind","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\A88ZJY26\Paulone and Ivlevs - 2019 - Emigration and alcohol consumption among migrant h.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\H8VIN97X\S0277953618306828.html","","","Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; Alcoholism; Emigration; Monetary remittances; Social remittances","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also housing condition is directly related with migration and significant impact can be seen in terms of facilities and type of household. Based on findings, it was provided some policy recommendations to simplicity of the social and other issues in the household of migrant's.

This has led to the belief that return migration stimulates entrepreneurship in source countries and hence supports economic development. In this paper, we test these assertions, drawing on the Life in Kyrgyzstan Study, a rich longitudinal data set from a transition economy with high levels of international temporary migration. We find that for return migrants, self-employment is often a temporary occupational choice, suggesting that self-employment serves as a 'parking lot'. In addition, we find evidence that return migrants who were self-employed before migrating are less likely to opt for self-employment on their return, implying that migration disrupts self-employment trajectories.

Electronic tax filing (e-filing) is an important example, as developing countries increasingly adopt online submission of tax declarations to replace in-person submission to tax officials. This paper examines the impact of e-filing on compliance costs, tax payments, and bribe payments using experimental variation and data from Tajikistan firms. Firms that e-file have lower compliance costs, spending five fewer hours each month on fulfilling tax obligations. There are no significant average effects of e-filing on tax or bribe payments, but significant heterogeneity exists across firms by their baseline likelihood of tax evasion. Among firms previously more likely to evade, e-filing doubles tax payments, likely by disrupting collusion with officials. Conversely, among firms less likely to have been evading, e-filing reduces tax payments, suggesting that officials had previously required them to pay more. These firms also pay fewer bribes, as e-filing reduces opportunity for extortion. In all, the results indicate that e-filing reduces compliance costs and makes the distribution of tax payments across firms arguably more equitable.","2018-05-22","2021-06-24 14:52:10","2021-06-24 14:52:58","2021-06-24 14:52:10","","","","","","","Technology, Taxation, and Corruption","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","BTMSI2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\TMEEME85\papers.html","","","De Facto Governments; Democratic Government; E-Government; Economic Adjustment and Lending; Economics and Finance of Public Institution Development; International Trade and Trade Rules; Macro-Fiscal Policy; Public Finance Decentralization and Poverty Reduction; Public Sector Administrative & Civil Service Reform; Public Sector Administrative and Civil Service Reform; Public Sector Economics; Tax Administration; Tax Law; Taxation & Subsidies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3183494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In collaboration with the Provincial Government of Kasaï-Central, we study a policy experiment in the D.R. Congo that randomly assigned 38,028 property owners to different property tax liabilities. We find that status quo tax rates are above the revenue-maximizing tax rate (RMTR). Reducing the property tax rate by approximately 34% would maximize government revenue, by increasing tax compliance. We then investigate how responses to tax rates interact with enforcement. We exploit two sources of variation in enforcement — randomized enforcement letters and random assignment of tax collectors — and show that the RMTR increases with enforcement. Replacing tax collectors in the bottom quartile of enforcement capacity by average collectors would raise the RMTR by 42%. Tax rates and enforcement are thus complementary levers. While a naive government that sequentially implements the RMTR and increases enforcement would raise revenue by 61%, a sophisticated government that prospectively implements the post-enforcement RMTR would instead raise revenue by 77%. These findings provide experimental evidence that low government enforcement capacity sets a binding ceiling on the revenue-maximizing tax rate in some developing countries, and thereby demonstrates the value of increasing tax rates in tandem with tax enforcement to expand fiscal capacity.","2021-05-01","2021-06-24 14:49:59","2021-06-24 14:50:23","2021-06-24 14:49:59","","","","","","","The State Capacity Ceiling on Tax Rates","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","BTMSI2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\XUC9QD4F\papers.html","","","Augustin Bergeron; Gabriel Tourek; Jonathan Weigel; SSRN; The State Capacity Ceiling on Tax Rates: Evidence from Randomized Tax Abatements in the DRC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3846228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many parallels between these two cases. Kyrgyzstan is in the process of entering the Eurasian Union, of which Russia is already a member. Similarly, Estonia has entered the European Union (EU), of which Finland is a member state. The difference in average wages between the home and host country is significant in both cases. There is also a certain lack of employee &quot;voice&quot; in the home country workplaces, making &quot;exit&quot; an easier option and undermining &quot;loyalty&quot; to the home country. Moreover, domestic politics in both Estonia and Kyrgyzstan tend to treat labour migrants as pragmatic agents seeking to maximise their own economic gains and downplay the social nature of labour migration. In doing this, governments are only encouraging their citizens to look for work outside of the country. The mechanism by which this occurs varies from country to country; much depends on the specific variations of each home country. The outcome, however, is the same: long-term plans to work abroad or emigrate on a permanent basis due to disillusionment with one’s life prospects in the home country.","2014","2021-06-24 14:46:57","2021-06-24 14:47:59","2021-06-24 14:46:57","","","","","","","Labour Migration in the Case of Estonia and Kyrgyzstan","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.semanticscholar.org","","TSW2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\DZ2NC2UP\c2ba84f859ba397e093895a05aa59be4c217c856.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7NDX8YAW","report","2015","Ajwad, Mohamed","The Skills Road: Skills for Employability in the Kyrgyz Republic","","","","","","This report analyzes the links in the Kyrgyz Republic between education, skills, and labor market outcomes. Using a unique household survey, the study finds that skills are valued in the Kyrgyz Republic labor market, yet skills gaps persist. Three findings are particularly noteworthy. First, higher skilled youth have better employment outcomes, meaning that youth with more cognitive and non-cognitive skills are more likely to be employed than inactive or discouraged youth. Second, workers with higher cognitive and non-cognitive skills are more likely to use those skills in their daily work. Third, workers with higher skills—cognitive skills especially—tend to have higher quality (formal sector, less repetitive tasks, less physical work) jobs. However, there are weaknesses in the way skills are formed in the Kyrgyz Republic. While skills are developed during different stages in the life cycle and a host of actors are involved—families, for example, play a central role—the education and training system has a mixed record in skill formation. The report argues that the government could shift some of its focus from providing access to educational institutions and instead focus on providing the skills (cognitive, non-cognitive, and technical) students need to succeed as adults. The government can also do more to get children off to the right start by investing in early childhood education where rates of return to investment are generally very high.

The Kyrgyz Republic has achieved rapid declines in stunting over the last 20 y, despite modest increases in gross domestic product per capita.This study aimed to conduct a systematic, in-depth assessment of national, community, household, and individual drivers of nutrition change and stunting reduction, as well as nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs, in the Kyrgyz Republic.This mixed methods study employed 4 inquiry methods, including: 1) a systematic scoping literature review; 2) retrospective quantitative data analyses, including linear regression multivariable hierarchical modeling, difference-in-difference analysis, and Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition; 3) qualitative data collection and analysis; and 4) analysis of key nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs.Stunting prevalence has decreased in the Kyrgyz Republic, however, subnational variations and inequities persist. Child growth Victora curves show improvements in height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) for children in the Kyrgyz Republic between 1997 and 2014, indicating increased intrauterine growth and population health improvements. The decomposition analysis explained 88.9% (0.637 SD increase) of the predicted change in HAZ for children under 3 y (1997–2012). Key factors included poverty (61%), maternal nutrition (14%), paternal education (6%), fertility (6%), maternal age (3%), and wealth accumulation (2%). Qualitative analysis revealed poverty reduction, increased migration and remittances, food security, and maternal nutrition as key drivers of stunting decline. Systematic scoping literature review findings supported quantitative and qualitative results, and indicated that land reforms and improved food security represented important factors. Key nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs implemented involved breastfeeding promotion, social protection schemes, and land and health sector reforms.Improvements in stunting were achieved amidst political and economic changes. Multilevel enablers, including poverty reduction, improved food security, and introduction of land and health reforms have contributed to improvements in health, nutrition, and stunting among children in the Kyrgyz Republic.","2020-09-14","2021-06-24 11:13:04","2021-06-30 14:03:27","2021-06-24 11:13:03","830S-843S","","Supplement_2","112","","The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","Drivers of stunting reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","MCS2018","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\N5ZBD3FW\5872357.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\EKWLQZWQ\Wigle et al. - 2020 - Drivers of stunting reduction in the Kyrgyz Republ.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis applies a random-effect model with lagged covariates to estimate the exogenous effect of riots on social capital. Households living in neighbourhoods prone to riots are more likely to invest in bridging social capital by joining community organizations but reduce face-to-face contact with neighbours. These effects are driven largely by levels of neighbourhood social fragmentation in riot-prone neighbourhoods. There, the salience of social identity is also reduced as individuals attempt to reach out across social divisions. We interpret these results as indicating that households instrumentally use bridging forms of social capital as an insurance against potential future communal violence in socially fragmented contexts where conflicting social groups live alongside each other.","2020-04-03","2021-06-24 11:07:49","2021-06-24 11:08:12","2021-06-24 11:07:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.wider.unu.edu","","ERPB2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\AX33LQ5V\riots-and-social-capital-urban-india.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\7ENJRT24\Aghajanian et al. - 2020 - Riots and social capital in urban India.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UZPSVR6Y","journalArticle","","Scacco, Alexandra; Warren, Shana S","Christian-Muslim Relations in the Shadow of Conflict","","","","","","In February 2000, large-scale Christian-Muslim riots shook the Nigerian city of Kaduna, killing thousands of people, and displacing tens of thousands more. Drawing on original survey data from a random sample of 300 young men living in particularly conﬂict-prone neighborhoods in Kaduna, we analyze patterns of Christian-Muslim relations ﬁfteen years after the February 2000 crisis. In this chapter, we argue that local exposure to deadly intergroup violence continues to have profoundly negative eﬀects on intergroup relations nearly two decades later. Kaduna residents on either side of the religious divide continue to exhibit high levels of mistrust and prejudice against members of the religious outgroup, and demonstrate substantial outgroup discrimination in behavioral games with real material stakes. We highlight three interrelated consequences of exposure to large-scale episodes of intercommunal violence, each of which complicates post-conﬂict reconciliation: (1) the erosion of intergroup trust, (2) the tendency that the violence increases local residential segregation along communal lines, and (3) lasting psychological eﬀects. We oﬀer micro-level evidence on each of these consequences from the Nigerian context, and caution against expectations that post-conﬂict communities should quickly bounce back from large-scale interreligious violence.","","2021-06-24 11:02:51","2021-06-24 11:03:03","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","ERPB2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\KQFRCKZP\Scacco and Warren - Christian-Muslim Relations in the Shadow of Confli.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans.

"AZ7VN428","thesis","2019","Pouliquen, Victor; Gurgand, Marc","The Impact of Economic Institutions on Small Firms in Developing Countries","","","","","https://www.theses.fr/2019EHES0190","Dans les pays en développement, les institutions économiques sont souvent défaillantes. Cela se traduit par des problèmes structurels tels que l’omniprésence du secteur informel, la corruption généralisée et l’incapacité des États à collecter les impôts. Cette thèse porte sur les politiques publiques permettant d’améliorer le fonctionnement des institutions économiques. Elle se focalise sur deux questions : (1) Quels sont les effets des politiques de réduction de l’informalité ? et (2) Comment les nouvelles technologies affectent la collecte des taxes ? Le premier chapitre étudie à l’aide d’une expérimentation aléatoire l’introduction d’un statut légal facilitant la formalisation des petites entreprises au Bénin. Afin de rendre ce statut attractif le gouvernement l’a accompagné d’incitations supplémentaires créés pour amplifier les bénéfices potentiels de la formalisation. Nous trouvons que très peu d’entreprises se formalisent lorsqu’elles reçoivent uniquement de l’information sur le nouveau statut. Cependant, lorsque l’information est combinée aux incitations, la formalisation augmente de 16,3 points de pourcentage. En revanche, les effets sur les performances des entreprises sont limités, et le coût des incitations est supérieur au total des impôts qu’elles paieront pendant les 10 prochaines années. Enfin, nous montrons comment un ciblage sur les entreprises ayant des caractéristiques proches des entreprises déjà formelles améliorerait l’efficacité de ce type de programme. Le second chapitre étudie l’impact de la formalisation sur les relations intra-ménages, toujours au Bénin. Dans ce contexte, la formalisation renforce les droits de propriété et clarifie au sein des ménages qui est le propriétaire légal de l’entreprise, et qui la gardera en cas de divorce. L’effet causal de la formalisation est identifié à l’aide de l’expérimentation aléatoire déjà utilisée pour le premier chapitre. Nous trouvons que les entrepreneurs s’étant formalisés ont plus de contrôle les ressources de leur ménage. Ils ou elles contribuent proportionnellement moins aux dépenses du ménage et transfèrent moins d’argent à leur partenaire. Deuxièmement, en utilisant un jeu comportemental dans lequel les entrepreneurs peuvent cacher un transfert monétaire à leur partenaire, nous trouvons que les femmes qui se sont formalisées cachent davantage à leur mari. A l’aide d’un modèle théorique, nous montrons que ce résultat est compatible avec l’idée que les femmes ne sont pas libres d’investir comme elles le souhaiteraient dans leur entreprise et doivent le faire secrètement. Notre conclusion est que la formalisation a des effets importants sur les dynamiques intra-ménage. Le troisième chapitre utilise une expérimentation aléatoire conduite au Tadjikistan pour étudier l’impact d’un système permettant aux entreprises de déclarer leurs taxes en ligne plutôt que de soumettre un formulaire en personne. Nous trouvons que ce système réduit le temps passé par les entreprises pour remplir leurs obligations fiscales de 5 heures par mois. Nous ne trouvons pas d’effets sur le montant des impôts payés ni sur le versement de pots-de-vin. En revanche, l’absence d’effets moyens masque une importante hétérogénéité. Les entreprises le plus susceptibles de faire de l’évasion fiscale dans le système précédent payent davantage d’impôts quand elles déclarent en ligne, probablement car elles ne peuvent plus entrer en collusion avec les agents des impôts. À l'inverse, les entreprises qui étaient les moins susceptibles de faire de l’évasion, payent moins des taxes quand elles déclarent en ligne, suggérant qu’elles étaient forcées de payer plus d’impôts avant. Ces entreprises paient également moins de pots-de-vin, ce qui suggère que déclarer en ligne offre une protection contre le risque d'extorsion de la part des agents du fisc. Notre conclusion est que permettre la déclaration des taxes en ligne a rendu l’appareil fiscal à la fois plus efficace et plus juste.","2019-12-10","2021-06-24 10:51:19","2021-06-24 10:51:47","2021-06-24 10:51:19","","","","","","","","","","","","Paris, EHESS","","","Licence Etalab","These de doctorat","","","theses.fr","","BTMSI2017","","","","","Droits de Propriétés; Économie souterraine; Electronic Tax Filing; Impôt; Impôt -- Recouvrement; Informalité; Informality; Innovations technologiques; Intra-Household Relationships; New Technologies; Nouvelles Technologies; Paiement en ligne des Taxes; Petites Entreprises; Petites et moyennes entreprises; Property Rights; Propriété; Relations Intra-Ménage; Small Firms; Taxation","","","","Gurgand, Marc","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"WJUFDABZ","journalArticle","","Agrawal, David R; Zimmermann, Laura","Production and Evasion Responses with Limited State Capacity - Evidence from Major Tax Reforms in India","","","","","","Taxes on transactions are a common way of raising tax revenue, mostly in the form of a sales tax or a value-added tax (VAT). We analyze the eﬀect of a switch from a sales tax to a VAT on output and tax evasion. States in India gradually transitioned from a sales tax to a VAT system. We digitize and harmonize all of India’s state-level consumption tax systems, which feature tax rates on hundreds of categories of goods that vary across states. Exploiting state- and product-speciﬁc tax variation and the staggered implementation of VAT across states, we show that by ﬁve years after the reform, gross sales increase by 16%. This increase in output is a result of the VAT lowering tax rates and reducing distortionary eﬀects of double taxation. Furthermore, in a sample of relatively large manufacturing ﬁrms, we ﬁnd limited evidence of bunching at registration thresholds indicating limited tax evasion. Our study has implications for India’s more recent reforms aimed at simplifying the tax law and for the consequences of a similar move in other countries.","","2021-06-24 10:49:19","2021-06-24 10:49:57","","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","BTMSI2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\I48VB4CJ\Agrawal-Zimmermann-2019-Working-paper.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Orthodox analyses of the state, however, have tended to focus only on formal taxation, formal budgets, and formal revenues. I correct his bias by extending the analysis of taxation and the state beyond formal tax systems, capturing the informal dynamics of public finance that affect the majority of citizens in low-income countries. By examining informal revenue generation in the context of formal taxation, I shed light on the how and why of the state and institutional development. This study presents a new approach to understanding formal–informal institutional interactions and offers insight into a set of tangible issues of critical importance to the citizens of modern states.   Classic theories of statehood anticipate that the state should always seek to control informal revenue generation. In practice, states often coexist with this informality. Informal taxing actors can reinforce state authority in unexpected ways and the relationship between the state and informal taxing actors is not necessarily zero-sum. State engagement with informal revenue generation is not always driven by a desire to gain a monopoly on taxation and authority. Instead, informal revenue generation may align with or even underpin the state’s governing strategy.   Informal revenue generation can also have counterintuitive effects on statebuilding. Though informality is usually seen as detrimental to statebuilding, I show that informal revenue generation can strengthen state institutional capacity. The politics of statebuilding are, at least in part, played out at the local level in conjunction with informal institutions. It is in these local processes where informal revenue generation and informal taxing actors can reinforce modern statehood and statebuilding processes. The state that emerges may not look like a rational, Weberian institutional model. Nevertheless, it may prove more resilient and dynamic than expected.","2020-11","2021-06-24 10:37:05","2021-06-24 10:37:41","2021-06-24 10:37:04","","","","","","","Informal Revenue Generation and the State","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","tspace.library.utoronto.ca","","BTMSI2017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet there remains an ongoing debate about whether slums provide a path to prosperity or an economic dead end. A second strand of research analyzes the negative externalities associated with urban density, and the challenges of building and maintaining infrastructure to moderate those harms. Researchers are just beginning to understand the links between institutions (such as public–private partnerships), incentives (such as congestion pricing), and the effectiveness of infrastructure spending in addressing urban problems. A third line of research addresses the spatial structure of cities directly with formal, structural models.

Regression analysis reveals that the share of time spent in the commercial rural nonfarm economy was larger in districts with low agricultural potential, indicating that the rural poor are pushed into accessible but not necessarily very profitable nonfarm activities. This 'push' scenario is probably strengthened by the low commercialisation and unfinished institutional reforms in the agricultural sector. Only in a few land-rich districts and in a district with a famous resort was labour 'pulled' into a profitable rural nonfarm economy stimulated by agricultural development and other local 'motors' of growth.","2012","2021-06-18 09:27:04","2021-06-18 09:44:53","","349-368","","2","64","","Eur.-Asia Stud.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","KIHS2006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kyrgyzstan, like other Central Asian countries, has experienced dramatic geopolitical changes, economic reform, and rapid demographic shifts in the post-Soviet-Union era. Based on measurements of GDP, it is one of the most remittance-dependent countries in the world. This study uses data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan Study collected from 2011 to 2013 to break down household budgets into eight consumption categories as part of a detailed analysis of how varying remittance receipt is related to household spending. We address two methodological concerns: (1) the endogeneity of remittances and (2) population heterogeneity. In so doing, we find remittances have limited effects on household spending – while changes in remittances do yield small changes on the budget shares of food and medical expenses, no effects were found on other consumption shares. These results suggest that households in Kyrgyzstan may take remittances as permanent income and proportionally alter consumption shares along with changes in remittances. By focusing on a country whose GDP relies heavily on remittances, the findings increase our understanding of how remittances affect spending at the household level.","2019-11-02","2021-06-18 08:52:52","2021-06-18 08:54:21","2021-06-18 08:52:51","1-22","","0","0","","","Remittances and household spending strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","LiK2013","","","","","household expenditure; Kyrgyz Republic; labour migration; livelihood; Remittance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The decomposition analysis explained 88.9% (0.637 SD increase) of the predicted change in HAZ for children under 3 y (1997–2012). Key factors included poverty (61%), maternal nutrition (14%), paternal education (6%), fertility (6%), maternal age (3%), and wealth accumulation (2%). Qualitative analysis revealed poverty reduction, increased migration and remittances, food security, and maternal nutrition as key drivers of stunting decline. Systematic scoping literature review findings supported quantitative and qualitative results, and indicated that land reforms and improved food security represented important factors. Key nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs implemented involved breastfeeding promotion, social protection schemes, and land and health sector reforms.Improvements in stunting were achieved amidst political and economic changes.

Study design A cross-sectional study based on the 2012 Kyrgyzstan Demographic and Health Survey data. Methods This study used data from 460 married men aged 20–49 years. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to estimate the prevalence of MCU, and to define factors that influence MCU among married men in Kyrgyzstan. Results The prevalence of MCU among married men aged 20–49 years was 22.2%. Men in the richer quintile were less likely to use modern contraceptives than men in the poorest quintile (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.267, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.100–0.715). Men with three living children had higher odds of MCU than men with no children or one child (aOR 3.534, 95% CI 1.221–10.229).

Anaemia was assessed by measuring the haemoglobin level in capillary blood of women aged 15 to 49 and their children under the age of 3 using the photometric Hemocue technique. The numbers of women tested were 3,658, 4,333, and 3,760 in Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic, respectively. All three Central Asian republics had a high prevalence of anaemia. The highest overall rates were in the regions of Kazakstan and Uzbekistan near the Aral Sea, which are characterized by severe agrochemical pollution and other environmental and socio-economic problems. Approximately half (49%) of the women in Kazakstan, 60% of the women in Uzbekistan, and 40% of the women in the Kyrgyz Republic suffered from some degree of anaemia. Mild anaemia (haemoglobin level, 10.0–11.9 g/dl; 10.0–10.9 g/dl for pregnant women) was diagnosed in 37%, 45%, and 28% of the women in Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic, respectively. Eleven percent of the women in Kazakstan, 14% in Uzbekistan, and 9% in the Kyrgyz Republic had moderate anaemia (haemoglobin level 7.0–9.9 g/dl). Severe anaemia (haemoglobin level less than 7.0 g/dl) was found among 1% of the women in all three Central Asian republics., In Kazakstan, 69% of the children under the age of three suffered from some degree of anaemia. About the same number of children had mild (30%) and moderate (34%) anaemia. A smaller, but substantial, proportion of children (5%) were severely anaemic. In Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, 61% and 50% of children, respectively, suffered from anaemia. The percentages of children with mild, moderate, and severe anaemia were 34%, 26%, and 1%, respectively, for Uzbekistan, and 24%, 24%, and 1%, respectively, for the Kyrgyz Republic., There is sufficient evidence to suggest that negative iron balance is probably a major cause of anaemia among both women and children in Central Asia. Our findings provide important information for the development of health intervention programmes to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia among women of certain ethnic, educational, and residential groups in this region. Based on the results of the Demographic and Health Survey as well as other geographically focused studies, the UNICEF Area Office for the Central Asian Republics and Kazakstan proposed an integrated strategy of education, supplementation, fortification, and research to address the problem and called for donors' support. It is expected that this approach can considerably improve maternal and child health in Central Asia.","1998-01-01","2021-06-28 12:27:09","2021-06-28 12:27:33","2021-06-28 12:27:09","307-317","","4","19","","Food Nutr Bull","Anaemia in Central Asia","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","DHS1997","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\L4FT74E4\Sharmanov - 1998 - Anaemia in Central Asia Demographic and Health Su.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective /Hypothesis. To determine whether MICS6 data on ‘functional difficulty associated with learning’ (FDAL) in low- and middle-income countries could be used as a proxy indicator for intellectual disability. Methods Secondary analysis of nationally representative data collected in Round 6 of UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) on 244,915 children in 18 middle- and low-income countries. Results The prevalence of FDAL in middle- and low-income countries was broadly similar to the estimated prevalence of intellectual disability in high-income countries. The association between risk of FDAL and household wealth was weak, with alternative measures of developmental delay showing significantly stronger associations with household wealth. The risk of making potential false negative errors in identifying FDAL increases as household wealth and level of maternal education decrease. The risk of making potential false positive errors in identifying FDAL is greater among more highly educated respondents, although this association is only statistically significant among older children. Conclusions The use of FDAL as a proxy indicator for intellectual disability cannot be recommended given: (1) it would probably underestimate the overall prevalence of intellectual disability in middle and low income countries; and (2) it is likely to be overestimate prevalence among families with higher socio-economic position (SEP) and underestimate prevalence among families with lower SEP.","2021-01-01","2021-06-28 11:50:07","2021-06-28 11:50:24","2021-06-28 11:50:07","100986","","1","14","","Disability and Health Journal","Identifying children at risk of intellectual disability in UNICEF’s multiple indicator cluster surveys","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","MICS2018","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\Y8H3YFEN\S1936657420301187.html","","","Disability; Low and middle income countries; MICS; Unicef","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge about IPV-related attitudes is essential for developing effective social work and violence-related programs. Using data from the 2005–2006 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, this study examines attitudes toward IPV and socio-demographic predictors of these attitudes among married women in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Women were asked whether they approved of a husband beating his wife: if she goes out without telling him, neglects their children, argues, refuses to have sex, and burns food. The prevalence of IPV acceptance for at least one of the five reasons varied from 12.3% in Kazakhstan to 45.3% in Kyrgyzstan and 74.5% in Tajikistan.

Women’s low levels of knowledge about HIV prevention and transmission methods have been found to account for the higher female-to-male ratio among cases infected through the heterosexual route. This cross national comparison study assessed comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge and its key determinants among women of seven post-Soviet countries and identified which countries face the highest levels of risk due to the low levels of HIV/AIDS awareness. Methods Study data were obtained from the third wave of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS3) (conducted in 2005 and 2006), nationally representative samples of women aged 15–49 years. Data on HIV/AIDS knowledge were analyzed for women in Kazakhstan (N=14,310), Kyrgyzstan (N=6,493), Tajikistan (N=4,676), Uzbekistan (N=13,376), Belarus (N=5,884), Ukraine (N=6,066), and Georgia (N=7,727) using descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. Results We found that the percentage of women who could correctly identify all five modes of HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention was highest in Eastern European countries of Belarus (34.98%) and Ukraine (31.67%). Across all countries, the strongest predictors of comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge were age, education, and region of residence. Marital status, area of residence (urban vs. rural), and household wealth were significant predictors for several countries. Conclusion High rates of comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge were found among women of Belarus and Ukraine. To reduce the spread of HIV in the region, programs promoting comprehensive HIV/AIDS knowledge for women of younger ages and with lower education are recommended.","2018-01-30","2021-06-28 11:43:21","2021-06-28 11:43:38","2021-06-28 11:43:21","295","","1","7","","Cent Asian J Glob Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","MICS2005","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\KYQ35KC7\Zainiddinov and Habibov - 2018 - A Comparison of Comprehensive HIVAIDS Knowledge A.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393054/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research on the influence of household crowding on violent discipline and neglect of children is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether household crowding was associated with violent discipline and neglect of children in low- and- middle-income countries (LMICs). Cross-sectional data for 280,005 and 73,030 children in 26 LMICs surveyed using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey were analyzed for (1) violent discipline and (2) neglect, respectively. In each country, we used logistic regression models to estimate the effects of household crowding on multiple forms of violent discipline and stimulation activities (as a proxy of the level of child neglect). Estimates were pooled using random effects meta-analyses. After adjusting for confounding variables, household crowding was associated with higher odds of any violent discipline (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.15, p = 0.002) and lower odds of engaging in four or more stimulation activities (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94, p &lt; 0.001).

Although this has been demonstrated in small-scale intervention studies, it is important to document whether book ownership is beneficial at large scale in low and middle-income settings. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis using data from the multiple-indicator cluster survey, covering 100 012 children aged 36-59 months, from 35 countries. The outcome was children being on-track for a literacy-numeracy index (LNI) constructed from three questions assessing children’s ability to identify/name at least 10 letters of the alphabet, read at least four simple popular words and know the names and symbols of all numbers from 1-10. The main exposure was availability of children’s book to the child within household. Analysis considered the survey design, assessed and ranked risk ratios of being on track, adjusting for potential confounders such as child’s age (in months), maternal education, household wealth index quintile and area of residence (rural/urban). Ecological analysis was performed using meta-regression after grouping countries by World Bank income groups (low- to high-income). Results Only half (51.8%) of children from all the countries analysed have at least one children’s book at home and less than one-third (29.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 23.5%, 36.3%) are on track for literacy-numeracy. After adjusting for confounders, the likelihood of being on track in literacy-numeracy almost doubled if at least one book was available at home compared to when there was none: RR = 1.89 (95% CI = 1.75, 2.03). There was an economic gradient showing that the likelihood of children being on track for LNI decreased with the country’s income group: adjusted-RR ranged from 1.65 in upper middle income to 2.23 in LIC (F-test P-value <0.0001). Only three high-income countries were included, and children’s books were universally available resulting in wide confidence intervals for the effect. Conclusions These findings are policy-relevant, as they corroborate the results from small scale experiments. Making children’s book available to children is a cheap and feasible intervention that could change home dynamics to improve the future economic fortunes of children especially in the poorest countries.","","2021-06-28 11:38:39","2021-06-28 11:39:02","2021-06-28 11:38:39","010403","","1","9","","J Glob Health","Association between availability of children’s book and the literacy-numeracy skills of children aged 36 to 59 months","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","MICS2014","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\KJ2QCSKP\Manu et al. - Association between availability of children’s boo.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204005/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Households, both poor and not poor, are directly and adversely affected by the crisis. The multi-dimensionality of the crises and the volatile economic environment challenge the ability of vulnerable households to cope and to maintain their living standards. Social protection programmes play an important role in the response to a crisis. This paper provides an overview of the social and economic vulnerabilities of households with children in the five Central Asian countries, and assesses the ability of national social protection systems to address these, with the main focus on the role of non-contributory cash transfers financed from general government revenues. The paper concludes that the existing social cash transfer systems are not effective in addressing the needs of poor and vulnerable children and families in Central Asia. Limited coverage together with limited funding reduces the potential poverty reduction impact of the programmes. The paper discusses potential strategies for improving existing systems by consolidating and protecting government spending, streamlining existing benefits and transfers, improving the identification of beneficiaries and strengthening administration, monitoring and evaluation systems.","2011","2021-06-28 07:48:22","2021-06-28 07:48:44","2021-06-28 07:48:22","","","","","","","Protecting vulnerable families in Central Asia","","","","","","","en","","","","","collections.unu.edu","","KIHS2008","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\E8Q6CR3F\Gassmann - 2011 - Protecting vulnerable families in Central Asia Po.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\2MUW332P\UNU64.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically, the paper investigates income generation and income diversification strategies employed by rural households in the northern part of Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan was one of the poorest Soviet Republics, which for nearly 20 nears since independence has been struggling with poverty, social and political instability. Qualitative approach of data collection, namely semi-structured interviews with experts and life history interviews with household members, was used in combination with quantitative data from previous studies as well as country reports of international aid organizations. It has been discovered that although agriculture remains an important driving force of the economy of the country, rural households rely on the income derived from agricultural activities as a safety net rather than main source of income. Rural household incomes were revealed to be largely comprised of income coming from rural nonfarm activities, including internal labor migration. The most successful risk management strategies were discovered to be employed by households that effectively utilized opportunities offered by both rural and urban areas – by combining regular wage employment as a stable source of income and farming income as a safety net.","2010","2021-06-28 07:41:56","2021-06-28 07:42:15","2021-06-28 07:41:56","","","","","","","Agriculture, Rural Nonfarm Economy and Income Diversification","","","","","","","eng","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","","","","lup.lub.lu.se","","KIHS2004","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\J48BMY9P\Bekturova - 2010 - Agriculture, Rural Nonfarm Economy and Income Dive.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\6W7RX3M8\1661351.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fill this gap, the research presented in this paper assesses a large-scale infrastructure project implemented in rural Kyrgyzstan. Using data on the scoring system designed to select villages for the project, this paper exploits a non-linearity that exists in the likelihood of being selected to identify the impacts of these improved water sources on village, household, and individual-level health-related outcomes. In doing so, the paper overcomes endogeneity concerns due to non-random village selection. The infrastructure project did improve water access in villages that are selected to receive a water supply system; households in such villages are less likely to use an unprotected source for their household water and are more likely to use a primary water source that is located less than 200 meters from the house. This results in a significant decrease in the village-level incidence of two water-related diseases, acute intestinal infections and Hepatitis A, in children 5 years old and younger. An analysis of impacts on incidence of a disease less likely to be directly affected by water access, specifically acute respiratory infections, was performed as a robustness check. As was hypothesized, there is no evidence that the improved water supply systems reduce acute respiratory infections.","2011-04","2021-06-28 07:37:25","2021-06-28 07:37:42","2021-06-28 07:37:25","","","","","","","Communal Taps","","","","","","","en_US","open","","","","dash.harvard.edu","","KIHS2008","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\ILZAIKGM\37366535.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\DK5JWZNC\Meeks - 2011 - Communal Taps Assessing the Impact of Shared Pipe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Literature on energy in the region has thus largely focused on related geopolitical issues and national policies. However, little is known about citizens’ needs within this broader context of commodities that connect the energy networks of China, Russia and the West. This multidisciplinary special issue brings together anthropologists, economists, geographers and political scientists to examine the role of all forms of energy (here: oil, gas, hydropower and solar power) and their products (especially electricity) in people's daily lives throughout Central Asia and the Caucasus. The papers in this issue ask how energy is understood as an everyday resource, as a necessity and a source of opportunity, a challenge or even as an indicator of exclusionary practices. We enquire into the role and views of energy sector workers, rural consumers and urban communities, and their experiences of energy companies’ and national policies. We further examine the legacy of Soviet and more recent domestic energy policies, the environmental of energy use as well as the political impact of citizens’ energy grievances.","2014-10-02","2021-06-28 07:21:34","2021-06-28 07:21:54","2021-06-28 07:21:34","435-448","","4","33","","","Mr Light and people's everyday energy struggles in Central Asia and the Caucasus","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","KIHS2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\JU6UEC98\02634937.2014.html","","","Central Asia; Afghanistan; Caucasus; conflict; electricity; energy; gas; identity; moral economy; oil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most EEU studies overlook Kyrgyzstan or focus on specific impact channels, such as changes in tariffs, re-exporting, or migration. We use a computable general equilibrium model to estimate the net impact of multiple channels. We incorporate uncertainty into our analysis using a stochastic simulation procedure and empirically-informed impact distributions. The results indicate that accession is expected to reduce national welfare, because falling profits from re-exporting outweigh higher migrant remittances and tariff revenues. There is, however, a one-in-four chance that national welfare increases, as well as a strong likelihood that poor households benefit from accession. Achieving these gains depends on the successful integration of regional labor markets, not just product markets, and on the proposed Russia-Kyrgyzstan Development Fund.

Remittances can be used to maintain the household’s standard of living by providing income to families with unemployed and underemployed adult members. Remittances can also be used to promote investment not only in businesses and communities but also in people. In this paper, we examine the role that remittances have played in the Kyrgyz Republic in promoting investments in children. Based on the capabilities approach to well-being initiated by Sen (2010), we look at the impact of remittances and domestic transfer payments primarily from internal migration on children’s education and health. Our outcomes include enrollment in school and preschool, expenditures, stunting and wasting of preschool children, and health habits of older children. We use unique panel data from the Kyrgyz Republic for 2005-2008 and thus control for some of the biases inherent in cross-sectional studies of remittances and family outcomes. We find that overall remittances and domestic transfers have not promoted investments in the human capital of children. Specifically, preschool enrollments were higher in the urban north but secondary school enrollments were lower in other regions in remittance receiving households; expenditures were also negatively affected in the south and the mountain areas. These negative enrollment results were larger for girls than for boys. We also found evidence of stunting and wasting among young children and worse health habits among boys in remittance or transfer receiving households. In the long run, Kyrgyzstan needs human capital development for growth; our results suggest that remittances are not providing the boost needed in human capital to promote development in the future.","2011-10-01","2021-06-28 06:38:45","2021-06-28 06:39:17","2021-06-28 06:38:45","","","","","","","Remittances and Children’s Capabilities","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","KIHS2008","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\BYQTIUGL\papers.html","","","Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; Children’s education and health; Remittances","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 1950540","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first paper explores whether improvements in water technology enable changes in household time allocation and, thereby, productivity gains. To do so, it exploits differences in timing of shared water tap construction across Kyrgyz villages. Households in villages that received the drinking water infrastructure are more likely to have water close to their homes. This reduced the time intensity of home production activities impacted by water. Village-level incidence of acute intestinal infections fell amongst children. Although adults show no signs of health improvements, they do benefit from reductions in the time spent caring for sick children. Individuals reallocate time savings to additional leisure and market labor, primarily work on the household farm, and the returns to the additional farm labor approximately equal the hourly farm wage. Time intensive water collection can be a source of gender inequality in households lacking water infrastructure. The second paper uses a natural experiment to investigate culture as a source of gender inequality and its role in determining gender roles for activities, such as water collection. Using exogenous variation in district-level cultural composition due to events in Kyrgyzstan during Soviet rule, I estimate the persistence of differences in gender equality between traditional sedentary farming cultures and nomadic herding cultures. Results indicate that Soviet institutions increased educational attainment in both cultures. Other cultural differences - such as gender of household water collector and perceptions of domestic violence - persist. One impediment to the construction of water infrastructure is insecure land tenure or property rights. The third paper explores whether alleviating this impediment through a program providing land titles in rural Peru is associated with improvements in water access. Utilizing the phased in timing, I exploit the differences in project implementation timing between households that held property titles prior to the project and those that did not. Results indicate that land titling is associated with increases in water access. Supporting evidence suggests that either the government or a utility might be responsible for the improvements.","2013-02-13","2021-06-28 06:17:40","2021-06-28 06:18:20","2021-06-28 06:17:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","closed access","","","","dash.harvard.edu","","KIHS unknown year","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\W9WDPQPM\10288830.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper is based on results of simulations generated through the application of standard MAMS, a computable general equilibrium model adjusted to the country situation and calibrated with data of Kyrgyzstan. MAMS-model-based simulation results indicate that a continuation of the current policies under the baseline scenario would allow for achieving MDG1 (poverty reduction) only; the country would fall short of the targets for other MDGs. In order to achieve all MDGs, the country needs to increase government spending on MDG-relevant sectors (education, health, water and sanitation) by 7.8-8.1% of GDP per annum in comparison to the baseline scenario. The scenario that combines increased taxes and aid inflows seems to be the most realistic, but it would still require very substantial increases in tax collections and grant aid. The situation is going to be easier, if the economic growth rates 2011-2015 would be higher than 7% per annum. This is possible, if the government would be more successful in implementation of structural reforms, FDI and private domestic investments attraction and mobilization of resources for infrastructure development. Another possible way out is a substantial increase in government spending efficiency allowing for receiving higher social returns for money spent.","2011-06-16","2021-06-28 05:15:50","2021-06-28 05:16:12","2021-06-28 05:15:50","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","KIHS2007","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\XQS6J2WF\papers.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\VK3FE7MY\Mogilevsky and Omorova - 2011 - Assessing Development Strategies to Achieve the MD.pdf","","","CGE model; kyrgyzstan; macroeconomic policies; millennium development goals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 1865746","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate that access to cleaner and more modern energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines and central heating are important for reducing solid fuel consumption, especially in rural areas. Regions with higher coal prices prefer cleaner heating, while regions with higher electricity prices prefer solid fuels. Education is important for the reduction of household solid fuel consumption.

Yet, the evidence on the impact of remittances on remaining household members is still thin. The focus of this study is on the impact of labor migration and remittances on measures of human capital investment. A unique dataset from Kyrgyzstan thereby allows us to investigate the impact of labor migration and remittances receipt on children’s educational outcomes in Kyrgyzstan. Along with the usual socio-economic controls, the Kyrgyzstan Integrated Household Survey delivers detailed information on remittances flows from 2005-2008. Our results show that remittances receipt has a negative impact on margin groups such as secondary or preschool-age children, particularly girls. Further we find that families with a high remittances- income ratio spend more on their children’s education than non-receiving households. However, families with a low remittances-income ratio spend even less than their non-receiving counterparts. Our results can be explained by the fact that the absence of a migrant household member can exert pressure on remaining members, mostly children and women, to contribute to the household’s workforce. Further, as migration in Kyrgyzstan is mostly male-dominated, girls are not expected to be the future bread-winner of the family and hence, their educational achievements are regarded as secondary.","2011","2021-06-28 04:52:53","2021-06-28 04:53:08","","","","","","","","Remittances and Children’s Schooling","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","KIHS2008","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\EHTWV3HP\Anderson and Kroeger - 2011 - Remittances and Children’s Schooling New Evidence.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\EDMUPHKW\download.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article argues that the choice of fuel depends on a number of endogenous and exogenous factors. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of the ‘energy ladder’ hypothesis, high income does not lead to a full switch to modern fuel, but rather facilitates the transition to consumption of energy from multiple fuel sources. Factors that increase the chances of full fuel transition are education and access to gas.

Increasing taxes on tobacco is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, but many opponents often cite regressivity as an argument against tobacco taxation. We use a mixed-methods approach to study the potential regressivity of tobacco taxation and the extent to which the regressivity argument hindered increases in tobacco taxation in Armenia. First, we pursued an extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) to assess the health, financial, and distributional consequences (by consumption quintile) of increases in the excise tax on cigarettes in Armenia. We simulated a hypothetical price hike leading to a tax rate of about 75% of the retail price of cigarettes, which would be fully passed on to consumers. Second, we conducted a series of stakeholder interviews to examine the importance of the regressivity argument and identify the factors that allowed tobacco tax increases to be adopted as public policy in Armenia. We show that increased excise taxes would bring large health and financial benefits to Armenian households. Half of tobacco-related premature deaths and 27% of associated poverty cases averted would be concentrated among the bottom 40% of the population. Though regressivity was raised as a concern at the initial stages of the policy adoption process, our qualitative stakeholder analysis indicates that the recent accession to the Eurasian Economic Union and the fiscal constraints faced by the government created a window of opportunity for tobacco taxation to be placed on the policy agenda and adopted as government policy, and the ECEA findings were an important input into the process.","2018-01-02","2021-06-28 04:32:47","2021-06-28 04:33:07","2021-06-28 04:32:47","30-41","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","KIHS2015","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\4UXYABKF\23288604.2017.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\7I4FJA2L\Postolovska et al. - 2018 - The Health Gains, Financial Risk Protection Benefi.pdf","","","Armenia; agenda setting; extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA); financial risk protection; tobacco taxation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the extent and the sources of such disparity is then important to help formulate policies that aim at avoiding further conflict. This paper analyzes economic disparity between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan. These groups were involved in violent clashes in the recent past. Using household survey data from 2005, we show that, in contrast to the public perception, Kyrgyz households have slightly higher expenditure than Uzbek households in urban areas and about the same level in rural areas. The gap in urban areas is mostly due to smaller households and higher education among the Kyrgyz. We also find that Uzbek households are better off than Kyrgyz households in terms of the value of housing property. We argue that the house value gap can be explained by the Uzbeks having larger houses, which are home to larger families and serve as a basis for running small businesses.","2014-12-01","2021-06-27 17:18:42","2021-06-27 17:18:42","2021-06-27 17:18:42","970-982","","4","42","","Journal of Comparative Economics","Ethnicity and the distribution of welfare","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\C4E8X328\S014759671400081X.html","","","Kyrgyzstan; Decomposition; Ethnicity; Household welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We intend to answer two questions. First, are Uzbek households better off than Kyrgyz households, as is often claimed in the media and also by some academics? Second, what are the correlates of household welfare in recent years, and how have these changed in comparison with the 1990s? We use data from two cross-sections of the Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey (2003 and 2005) and run OLS regressions using three measures of welfare, i.e. per capita consumption, per capita income, and an asset index. We find some evidence for higher welfare of Uzbek headed households compared with their Kyrgyz counterparts, but mainly in rural areas. In the south of the country, where most Uzbeks live and where the violence took place, there appears to be no substantial difference in welfare. This is clearly in contrast to what was commonly propagated in the media and what most Kyrgyz tend to think. In terms of the other correlates of welfare, we find that household size, educational attainment of adults, and residence outside the capital and the neighbouring Chui oblast are most importantly connected with welfare. This coincides with findings from earlier studies using data from a decade earlier.","2011","2021-06-27 17:14:53","2021-06-27 17:15:09","2021-06-27 17:14:53","","","","","","","Are Uzbeks Better Off?","","","","","Kiel und Hamburg: ZBW - Deutsche Zentralbibliothek für Wirtschaftswissenschaften, Leibniz-Informationszentrum Wirtschaft","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","","","","www.econstor.eu","","KIHS2005","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\W947THJZ\48342.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\V62BKJDT\Steiner and Esenaliev - 2011 - Are Uzbeks Better Off Economic Welfare and Ethnic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This analysis was conducted to determine which households would be most affected by higher energy tariffs and to what extent mitigation measures, such as lifeline tariffs or direct cash transfers, might lessen the impact for poor and vulnerable households. The analysis focused on first-order effects and used benefit incidence analysis and static micro-simulation to estimate the expected costs and benefits of higher energy prices and the corresponding mitigation measures. The results suggest that both the type of energy and the level of connectedness matter. Increasing tariffs for thermal power used for central heating and hot water mainly affects richer households in urban areas. Reducing implicit electricity subsidies affects the entire population due to nearly complete country coverage with electricity connections. Both lifeline tariffs and direct cash transfers could mitigate the effect of higher electricity tariffs at lower costs than universal subsidies.","2014-08-01","2021-06-27 17:11:21","2021-06-27 17:11:36","2021-06-27 17:11:21","755-769","","3","42","","Journal of Comparative Economics","Switching the lights off","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","KIHS2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\M34JAWCD\S0147596713000577.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\9RPKDGVH\Gassmann - 2014 - Switching the lights off The impact of energy tar.pdf","","","Kyrgyz Republic; Poverty; Energy subsidy; Social transfers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite itsdevelopment, the impact it has on entrepreneurship is a subject of debate. Scholarly articles haverecently emerged outlining that successful entrepreneurship depends on individual and householdcharacteristics, and on the status of the microfinance loan received. This paper investigatesthe impact of microfinance on entrepreneurship in Kyrgyzstan using the nationally representativehousehold survey data for 2013. Due to the endogeneity issue, we applied the binary responsemodel with instrumental variables. After the adjustment for endogeneity, the result indicatesthat access to microcredit has a significant positive impact on entrepreneurship and showsthere is a significant gender difference between men and women when making the decision tobecome an entrepreneur. Thus, men are more likely to become an entrepreneur than women.Another interesting finding is that elderly, less educated, and married individuals are more likelyto be entrepreneurs. Therefore, it can be assumed that entrepreneurship in Kyrgyzstan is mostlyrepresented by unskilled workers, many of which are unpaid family workers and self-employedwho manage small trade markets, shops, and own land in order to generate income that does notrequire a particular education or labour skills.","2018-06-01","2021-06-27 17:10:06","2021-06-27 17:10:06","","24-40","","","2018","","Acta Oeconomica Pragensia","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\8LAF738R\Sultakeev et al. - 2018 - The Impact of Microfinance on Entrpreneurship in K.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326267522_The_Impact_of_Microfinance_on_Entrpreneurship_in_Kyrgyzstan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impact very much depends on a household's energy basket and the available strategies for switching to alternative energy sources. Using data from the 2011 Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey, this article analyses the profile of household energy consumption and the impact of electricity tariff increases on the probability that households would switch to alternative energy sources.

Three sets of questions are posed in three separate chapters. First, in regards to migration: why do some individuals intend to migrate whereas others do not; and does the intention to migrate affect actual migration behaviour? Second, in regards to remitting: which migrants are more likely to remit; and which migrants remit more? Third, in regards to spending: is it migrants themselves who decide how their remittances are spent; and to what extent do remittances offset the monetary cost of hosting festivities regarded as “customs and traditions”? In search of answers, the dissertation resorts to a statistical analysis of national household survey data from the Kyrgyz Republic. The choice of the methodology is based to the availability of a robust dataset that is suitable for empirical methods, and to the fact that the country is highly dependent on migration and remittances. Several key empirical findings emerge from the analyses. First, the intention to migrate is correlated with travel experience, ethnicity, access to a family network abroad and regional unemployment; also, an intention does have a strong positive impact on actual migration behaviour. Second, the incidence of remitting is increased consistently in the case of men and older migrants, whereas the amount of remittances per remitter is higher when sent by household heads or highly educated migrants, especially to urban or post-shock households. Third, remitters often do not decide how their remittances are used, and remittances-receiving households spend on average more on some types of festivities, but not on all; despite the high average expenditures on festivities, gifts received by households substantially offset the total cost, thus reducing the financial burden of hosting such events. Policy-relevant implications of the findings as well as suggestions for further research are discussed.","2016","2021-06-26 14:19:29","2021-06-26 14:20:01","2021-06-26 14:19:29","","","","","","","International Labour Migration, Remittances and Remittances-based Spending","","","","","Carleton University","","English: en-CA","","Text","","","curve.carleton.ca","","LiK2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\G2R9PRD6\Ostropolski - 2016 - International Labour Migration, Remittances and Re.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3CWU47US\b76a34c3-fc29-4902-8167-a39c8500e783.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indexing Job Quality and the Impact of “Bad Jobs” on Wellbeing in Kyrgyzstan","","","","","","While there is broad agreement that job quality is a multidimensional concept, scholarship has tended to focus on the measurement, rather than effects, of bad jobs. This deficit is particularly stark in developing countries, which to date have been almost entirely ignored in academic literature. In this article, we generate four indices of job quality using a series of different weighting mechanisms and test their impact on subjective wellbeing in Kyrgyzstan. Employing OLS and ordered probits, we show that bad jobs are a significant determinant of lower subjective wellbeing across all indices. Splitting our sample into wageworkers and self-employed, however, we show this relationship holds only for former group. Subsequently, testing equality of the coefficients shows that for wageworkers with mean wellbeing, a move from equal to person-specific weights leads to a 50% increase in the impact of a one standard deviation decrease in job quality. Given the negative wellbeing impacts of bad jobs, at least for wageworkers, these results highlight the importance of further research in the developing world. Furthermore, they show both the importance of accurate job quality measurement and of the need to appropriately conceptualise labour markets in the developing world when conducting such analyses.","","2021-06-26 13:57:41","2021-06-26 13:57:56","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\N4XBUHVT\Esenaliev and Ferguson - Weighting the Obvious Indexing Job Quality and th.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"AJL8LBNS","journalArticle","","Steiner, Susan","Migration and Social Networks in Kyrgyzstan: Informal Transfers in the Sending Communities","","","","","","Previous research investigating the link between social networks and migration primarily seeks to answer how networks affect migration decisions or labour market outcomes at the destination. Little attention has been paid to the possibility that migration might affect the degree of cooperation within social networks of households left behind at the origin. In this paper, we argue that migration and remittances could either strengthen or weaken the degree of informal transfers within social networks. We use data from a detailed household survey in Kyrgyzstan, designed by the authors, to empirically study the effect of migration and remittances on both financial and non-financial informal transfers. We find that migrant households make more financial transfers than non-migrant households, particularly in rural areas. The same is true when we compare households that receive remittances with households that do not receive remittances. The fact that there is no large difference in the effect of migration and the effect of remittances comes from the large analogy between these two aspects. Most households in Kyrgyzstan that have migrants abroad also receive remittances. Furthermore, we find that the receipt of non-financial help in the form of labour appears to be driven by the neediness of households. Only those migrant households with dependants receive more non-financial help than others.","","2021-06-26 13:56:28","2021-06-26 13:56:39","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","LiK2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\QPACY5PH\Steiner - Migration and Social Networks in Kyrgyzstan Infor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet do these assumptions of the life-course approach apply to housework participation in Central Asia? We analyze time-use diaries from the Life in Kyrgyzstan panel data, 2012-2013, to show that in Kyrgyzstan, gender performances in housework by age are contrary to the expectations laid out by the life-course approach. Among working age women, older women do less housework. These results reveal the effects of the kainene-kelin (mother-in-law and bride) relations on housework participation, when younger brides in households are expected to assume more housework than older women.

The sample includes 60 males who were continuously employed, married, and who were 25 – 46 years old during the sample period which covers years 2010 – 2012. 2SLS estimation technique was applied to estimate the labor supply function and the specification for the individual effects. The former provided the estimate of the intertemporal substitution elasticity, the latter determined the parameters necessary to describe the labor supply response to parametric wage changes. Results suggest that, contrary to the existing literature and MaCurdy’s own findings, the estimated coefficient for the intertemporal elasticity is negative, however statistically insignificant. Uncompensated and compensated elasticities are estimated to be negative and close to zero. The lack of predictive power of the proposed instruments is likely to be the main reason for the obtained results.

A research thread within the managerial literature is to investigate the role of gender similarity, or gender match, between the supervisor and the subordinate on the subordinate’s job satisfaction. Grounded on the theories of relational demography (Tsui & O’Reilly, 1989) and leader-member exchange (Liden, Sparrowe, & Wayne, 1997), authors such as Tsui and O’Reilly (1989) and Green, Anderson and Shivers (1996), have found support gender matching to be positively related to positive employee outcomes, while others have found no effect (e.g., Epitropaki & Martin, 1999; Liden, Wayne, & Stilwell, 1993). Following the arguments in leader member-exchange theory, a buffering hypothesis of work autonomy and work meaningfulness can also be made, such that given the higher job satisfaction in gender matched subordinates, the well-established effect of work autonomy and meaningfulness on job satisfaction will be suppressed. Using composite items from LiK 2013 data, we found an opposite effect for gender match dyads, where dissimilar supervisor gender is related to higher job satisfaction. This effect is unexpected and not found elsewhere. Investigation of the buffering hypothesis revealed no moderating effect. But consistent with other data we collected in Kyrgyzstan, work autonomy is seen to have less of an effect on job satisfaction than observed in other countries.

Some Insights from the 'Life in Kyrgyzstan Survey'.","","","","","","Kyrgyz Republic - Poverty and economic mobility in the Kyrgyz Republic : some insights from the life in Kyrgyzstan survey (English) ABSTRACT This report focuses on the economic mobility of individuals (and corresponding households) belonging to the bottom 40 percent of the Kyrgyz population. This is indeed the target population chosen by the World Bank Group for the achievement of its second and twin goal of shared prosperity (the first one remaining poverty reduction). Moreover, in the specific case of the Kyrgyz Republic total poverty rates in the period under analysis ranged between 34 and 37 percent, thus making the poverty and bottom 40 percent pools almost identical. For each selected transition group, the report depicts a detailed profile of corresponding main socio-economic characteristics. Four transition groups were in particular identified: (i) those who were found to be stuck in the bottom 40 percent in both 2010 and 2011; (ii) those who managed to move up from the bottom 40 percent in 2011; (iii) those who entered the bottom 40 percent in 2011, and (iv) those who managed to stay in the top 60 percent in both years under analysis. The evidence shows a few significant differences among these four groups in terms of both households’ invariant and individual characteristics.","2015-04-27","2021-06-25 12:58:24","2021-06-25 12:59:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","LiK2011","","; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\FFHS2WTV\Guelfi and Sattar - 2015 - Poverty and Economic Mobility in the Kyrgyz Republ.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310457904_Poverty_and_Economic_Mobility_in_the_Kyrgyz_Republic_Some_Insights_from_the_'Life_in_Kyrgyzstan_Survey'","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A priori, it is indeterminate whether migration and remittances strengthen or weaken the degree of private transfers in these communities. From a policy perspective, public income redistribution programs would have an important role to play if migration reduced the extent of private transfers. Using household survey data from rural Kyrgyzstan, we find that households with migrant members (as well as households receiving remittances) are more likely than households without migrants (without remittances) to provide monetary transfers to others and to receive non-monetary (i.e. unpaid labor) transfers from others. This suggests that migrant households, through their access to remittance income, insure their social networks against shocks or redistribute income to poorer households in the community and receive labor transfers in return. This implies that migration is unlikely to lead to a weakening of private transfers.","2015-08-01","2021-06-25 12:55:36","2021-06-25 12:55:55","2021-06-25 12:55:36","690-705","","3","43","","Journal of Comparative Economics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","LiK2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\7BZCTT9Z\S0147596714000894.html","","","Kyrgyzstan; Cash and labor exchange; Migration; Private transfers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on a large number of asset and consumption items, we create an index of visible wealth by aggregating visible goods and assets using principal component weights. We show that relative deprivation in visible wealth has a significantly stronger effect than income in determining levels of perceived relative deprivation.

A concept of social cohesion was applied which understands cohesion to be made up of close social relationships, intensive emotional connectedness, and a strong orientation towards the common good. Using baseline survey data from 30 sub-districts (Ayil Aimak), exploratory factor analysis and scale standardization were carried out to calculate social cohesion scores for each sub-district and their respective villages. The results show that social cohesion generally appears to range from moderate to moderately high, however the dimensions of social networks and solidarity and helpfulness in particular can still be improved. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed relationships between social cohesion and a number of potential determinants and outcomes, hinting at areas where the intervention project could concentrate efforts or advocacy to indirectly impact social cohesion (e.g., through paved routes into communities, improvements in the power supply, encouraging communication in multiple languages). Suggestions for future assessments of social cohesion at the project’s midline and endline are also outlined.","2016","2021-06-25 12:48:57","2021-06-25 12:49:18","2021-06-25 12:48:57","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\4PXPFVQE\papers.html","","","social cohesion; Kyrgyz Republic; Social Cohesion Index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2946732","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bride kidnapping—a form of forced marriage—implies that women are abducted by men and have little choice other than to marry their kidnappers. Given this lack of choice over the spouse, we expect adverse consequences for women in such marriages. Remarkable survey data from the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan enable exploration of differential birth outcomes for women in kidnap-based and other types of marriage using both OLS and IV estimation. We find that children born to mothers in kidnap-based marriages have lower birth weight compared with children born to other mothers. The largest difference is between kidnap-based and arranged marriages: the magnitude of the birth weight loss is in the range of 2 % to 6 % of average birth weight.

Little is known about the extent to which this practice is truly involuntary rather than ritualized elopement, or the harm that it may cause. We contribute to the understanding of marriage following bride capture by exploring behavioral similarities of couples in these marriages relative to those in arranged or “love” marriages. We use the 2013 wave of the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey to compute profile similarity indices for couples, and use regression analysis to explore the association between marriage type and similarity in personality, controlling for demographic variables. We find that couples in forced marriages turn out to be far less similar than other couples, especially for those who have only recently married. This greater dissimilarity is inconsistent with staged or ritualized elopement as a characterization of ala kachuu. Couples in marriages following bride capture not know each other nearly as well, and it is implausible that all of these marriages are consensual.

Using a household fixed effects regression model, we find that while a drought shock increases the likelihood of migration, winter and earthquake shocks reduce the likelihood of migration. We use a simple theoretical framework to illustrate the trade-off between two effects of a shock for a household: loss of income and increase in the need of labor services. We show that migration increases when the former effect of a shock dominates, it reduces when the latter effect dominates. We explore these mechanisms by examining how the migration-response to shocks changes in the presence of alternate coping mechanisms and by evaluating the effect of shocks on a household's decision to send and recall a migrant member. We find that when households have easier access to informal finance the migration-response is muted only for shocks for which the adverse income effect dominates. Our findings also suggest that while shocks for which the loss of income effect dominates have a greater effect on the decision to send a migrant, shocks for which the need of labor services effect dominates only affect the decision to recall a migrant. These findings provide evidence in favor of the proposed mechanisms through which shocks affect temporary migration.","2021-01-25","2021-06-25 11:30:29","2021-06-25 11:30:50","2021-06-25 11:30:29","","","","","","","Temporary International Migration, Shocks and Informal Insurance","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\G5FX3Y93\papers.html","","","SSRN; Manish Pandey; Shocks and Informal Insurance: Analysis Using Panel Data; Tanika Chakraborty; Temporary International Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3771734","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This finding suggests that the practice of bride abduction adversely affects women's probability of employment and might have negative consequences on their economic well-being.","2021-03-03","2021-06-25 11:28:36","2021-06-25 11:29:06","2021-06-25 11:28:36","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiK2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\U2U65948\papers.html","","","SSRN; Alma Kudebayeva; Altay Mussurov; Bride Kidnapping and Labour Supply Behaviour of Married Kyrgyz Women; Reza Arabsheibani","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3794079","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some households are relatively flexible by acquiring more efficient electrical appliances or shifting to other sources of energy while for some group of people it is quite costly to do so. They would rather compensate for increased cost of electricity by reducing consumption of other goods and services from the consumer basket which are relatively elastic. This paper evaluates the impact of two-tiered electricity price increase reform on consumer well-being by analyzing the consumption basket structure. I analyze the effect of the electricity tariff hike on the households’ consumption expenditure patterns, by using various regressions, including the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), the fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) methods for each consumption basket category for the aggregated consumption based on Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey for 2014, 2015 and 2016. The results suggest that the policy effect on the consumption of non-food category was positive, suggesting that household welfare was not reduced. However, new tariff reforms are associated with a decrease in demand for the durable goods category. The effect on the housing and food expenditure categories is insignificant.","2019","2021-06-25 07:15:06","2021-06-25 07:15:26","2021-06-25 07:15:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","mt.osce-academy.kg","","KIHS2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\4WTVELE9\378.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article contributes to cross-national evidence on the roots and expressions of ethno-racial socio-economic inequalities and on nation building and nationalism in the post-Soviet context. It uses data from two identically designed nationally representative surveys conducted in Kyrgyzstan in 2011 and 2017 to investigate patterns and trends in ethnic and linguistic disparities in employment by occupational type and economic sector and in earnings among men and women. The authors find that despite government policies to promote the advancement of the nation's titular majority, Kyrgyz, and to encourage the use of its language, the ethno-linguistic economic inequalities inherited from the Soviet era — privileged positions of the European-origin minority and of Russian-speaking Kyrgyz — were still potently present in the earlier survey. While variations in types of occupation and employment sectors tended to diminish between the two surveys, the ethno-linguistic differences in earnings remained very pronounced, even after controlling for other factors. The authors relate these findings to the extant scholarship and reflect on their implications for our understanding of post-socialist transitions.","2020","2021-06-25 05:35:13","2021-06-25 05:35:29","2021-06-25 05:35:13","1579-1612","","6","51","","","Continuities in Transition","","","","","","","en","© 2020 International Institute of Social Studies","","","","Wiley Online Library","","LiK2010","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\D4V3MNG4\dech.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper empirically estimates potential work disincentives of a means-tested social transfer for adults with different household positions. Using data from the Kyrgyz Integrated Household Survey 2012, the analysis compares labor market outcomes for household heads and spouses using quasiexperimental methods to assess transfer effects on labor supply. Overall, beneficiaries have on average higher labor market participation rates, but results differ by household position and socioeconomic context. Household heads in beneficiary households are less likely to be economically active than similar nonbeneficiaries. Yet, spouses are more likely to be economically active. Moreover, outcomes depend on whether the household is located in the south or the north of the country.","2019-04-01","2021-06-25 05:28:30","2021-06-25 05:28:46","2021-06-25 05:28:30","189-214","","2","31","","Eur J Dev Res","Effect of Means-Tested Social Transfers on Labor Supply","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","KIHS2012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this paper is to examine the extent to which scientific impact evaluation methods can provide evidence to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in humanitarian action. This paper explores the methodological options and challenges associated with generating high quality evidence needed to answer key questions about the performance of humanitarian assistance, including whether assistance is reaching the right people, at the right time, is bringing about the desired changes in their lives (effectiveness) and is being delivered in the right doses, ways and with manageable costs (efficiency). With the help of six case studies and drawing on real-life examples from the small but growing academic literature, we demonstrate how impact evaluation methods can be used successfully and in an ethical manner to improve humanitarian assistance. A key lesson from our review is that it pays to be prepared. Much information is being collected these days about the risks of various emergencies unfolding, be they sudden onset or slow onset emergencies. Hence national actors and international donors can prepare for these events and for conducting meaningful impact evaluations. Given the overwhelming needs and the lack of funds, doing more with limited resources is a key challenge for humanitarian assistance and impact evaluation is one way of achieving this.","2015","2021-06-25 05:26:31","2021-06-25 05:26:55","2021-06-25 05:26:31","","","","","","","","","","","","IZA Discussion Papers","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","LiK2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\LY9WGPPB\Puri et al. - 2015 - What Methods May Be Used in Impact Evaluations of .pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\TAHJDDJZ\107542.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8755","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Households continue using traditional fuels in addition to the clean fuels. The main objective of this paper is to explain the choice of dirty cooking fuels even when access to electricity is provided. We use nationally representative household survey data to study the household energy use decisions in three middle-income countries, namely, India, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. The study discusses the role of access to natural gas, free fuel, convenience or multi-use of fuels featured by the heating system installed, built-in environment, and other socio-economic factors in household fuel choice for cooking. The results show that access to natural gas increases the likelihood of opting for clean fuel, while the availability of free fuel in rural areas and the coal-based heating system promote the use of solid fuels.","2021-07-15","2021-06-25 05:24:56","2021-06-25 05:25:21","2021-06-25 05:24:56","112539","","","290","","Journal of Environmental Management","Why energy access is not enough for choosing clean cooking fuels?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","LiK2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\2UXECTFY\S0301479721006010.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\UFK7HSSB\Kapsalyamova et al. - 2021 - Why energy access is not enough for choosing clean.pdf","","","Cooking fuel; Energy access; Fuel choices; Multiple fuel use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, women facing a risk of kidnapping may reduce education investment due to uncertain returns. Alternatively, since kidnapping is less likely to occur while a woman is in school, women may increase education investment to lower their personal risk of being kidnapped into marriage. Understanding how education is affected by kidnapping risk allows us to better anticipate changes in education when the laws are enforced and the risk declines. We develop a two-period utility model to highlight the effects of kidnapping risk on education and to help identify those girls who are most likely to increase their education when faced with positive regional kidnapping risk and thus most likely to reduce education if the risk is eliminated. We test the implications of the theory empirically using the Life in Kyrgyzstan data. Difference-in-difference regression results point to a negative relationship between regional kidnapping rates and education, suggesting that the elimination of kidnapping is likely to induce higher education rates of women in Kyrgyzstan. The results are informative to the literature at the intersection of marriage traditions, women's bargaining power and education attainment.","2021-03-01","2021-06-25 04:38:25","2021-06-25 04:40:51","2021-06-25 04:38:25","147-163","","1","49","","Journal of Comparative Economics","Marriage traditions and investment in education","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","LiK2016???","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\IVT7QZFK\S0147596720300445.html","","","Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; Bride kidnapping; Marriage traditions; Returns to education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One considers the poor in the developing world as operating in imperfect markets. Another view is that the poor are subject to constraints. The policy prescriptions stemming from these views would be improving market access and redistribution. We consider one important constraint the poor are facing: social norms which require  spending  on ceremonial activities. This paper adds to the literature by providing empirical evidence that having access to loans makes households spend more on ceremonies and with the higher ceremonial spending they increase the likelihood of debt thus creating a vicious circle which might keep households in poverty. Thus policies which are aimed at either removing market frictions or providing benefits  to the poor will not have a desired effect. These measures have to be combined with reforms aimed at changing the existing institutions.","2019-01","2021-06-25 04:31:22","2021-06-25 04:31:39","2021-06-25 04:31:22","","","","","","","Social Norms, Status Spending and Household Debt","","","","","","","en","","MPRA Paper","","","","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\MRTEFWTW\91363.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\FD9KS3XN\Aldashev - 2019 - Social Norms, Status Spending and Household Debt .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach makes it possible to indicate the impact of migration not only through the labour supply analysis, which may be limited by reflecting labour market behaviour only, but also through the measure of allocation of time among different activities at home. To address the issue of endogeneity, the instrumental variable approach is applied. Results show that the migration of a household member increases the choice of left-behind women to be unpaid family workers. Most of the left-behind women choose unpaid family work and work more hours in this occupation. Although in the labour supply analysis wage-employment is not affected by migration, time-use model estimations reveal that wage-employed women are mostly affected through increases in the time for housework.","2017","2021-06-25 04:29:57","2021-06-25 04:30:31","2021-06-25 04:29:57","","","","","","","Migration impact on left-behind women's labour participation and time-use","","","","","WIDER Working Paper","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","LiK2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\5WTMHQ3M\163083.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\RLUHT4EU\Karymshakov and Sulaimanova - 2017 - Migration impact on left-behind women's labour par.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017/119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, available migration networks, household financial capacity and involvement in agriculture are sources of differential impacts.

International movement of labor and the related flow of  remittances are likely to have serious implications for developing countries. Central  Asian countries are not an exception in this regard with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan  being among the largest recipient countries of remittances as a share of GDP. Indeed,  Kyrgyzstan has become the top remittance-recipient country in the world as a share of  GDP over the last two years (34.5 percent in 2016 and the projection of 37.1 percent  this year). However, the empirical literature on the impact of both migration and  remittances in countries of Central Asia, including Kyrgyzstan, is quite limited.  This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature. Specifically, it analyzes  the micro-level data from the unique longitudinal survey of households and  individuals and examines the trends and patterns of remittances flow to Kyrgyzstan  based on the macro-level data from the World Bank. Second, it enlarges virtually nonexistent body of literature on the relationship between remittances and human capital  outcomes of children in Kyrgyzstan. The research applies the logistic, fixed-effects,  and Hausman-Taylor techniques to the three-year panel dataset from the “Life in  Kyrgyzstan” survey to mitigate the problem of pervasive endogeneity.  Even though our empirical results in most cases indicate that remittances do  not have a statistically significant impact on school enrollment, educational  expenditure and health outcomes of children (the health indicator of underweight  being the exception), the research still provides useful insights on what really  contributes and how these effects vary across age-specific and regional sub-samples.","2017","2021-06-25 04:19:22","2021-06-25 04:19:41","2021-06-25 04:19:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","mt.osce-academy.kg","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\YVQ36VNZ\84.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While signiﬁcant progress in understanding the micro-level foundations of violence is being made, quantitative evidence on individual and group interactions in displacement environments is still relatively scarce. In this paper, we use unique household and individual survey data from Kyrgyzstan to study the causes and eﬀects of the country’s 2010 episodes of ethnic violence and forced displacement. The detailed information available on displacement at household and individual level allow for an in-depth analysis of the dynamics underlying the violence. Focusing on conﬂict-related displacement, our results conﬁrm horizontal inequalities between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks to be among the main drivers of the riots, while hardly any eﬀects are found for vertical inequalities or the presence of ethnically diverse populations per se. At the individual level, the decision to ﬂee from conﬂict-prone areas is shown to depend on various demographic, social and economic factors.","","2021-06-25 04:08:17","2021-06-25 04:08:47","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","LiK2010","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\DHLRFAH5\Brueck et al. - Who has to leave and why Displacement in Kyrgyzst.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many regard this practice as harmless elopement or a tradition; others perceive it as a form of forced marriage. OBJECTIVE This paper contributes to the understanding of ala kachuu by exploring the extent to which couples in these marriages differ from those in arranged or love marriages. METHODS We use the 2013 wave of the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey to compute profile similarity indices for the personality of couples. We then regress marriage type on the profile similarity index, controlling for sociodemographic variables. RESULTS Couples in marriages resulting from bride capture are far less assortatively matched on personality traits than other couples, especially those who have only recently married. CONCLUSIONS This greater dissimilarity is consistent with ala kachuu being forced marriage rather than merely staged or ritualized elopement. CONTRIBUTION This paper provides a novel source of evidence on the possible nonconsensual nature of bride capture in Kyrgyzstan, adding further weight to those arguing that it is forced.","2019","2021-06-25 03:52:34","2021-06-25 03:52:56","2021-06-25 03:52:34","579-592","","","41","","","How marriages based on bride capture differ","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","LiK2013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social transfers in cash and in kind in place in Kyrgyzstan absorbed 5.7% of GDP in 2012. They include subsidies to social insurance pensioners, transfers to population groups considered vulnerable or deserving, and transfers to families with children in extreme poverty. Social transfers are generally pro-old and maternalist in orientation, and therefore strongly gendered. Using data from the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey, the paper throws light on whether social transfers are associated with labour supply decisions of women at the extensive and intensive margins, and with birth spacing. The results indicate that social assistance transfers are associated with lower probabilities of participation and hours for women and marginally increase the relative risk giving birth.","2015-12-16","2021-06-25 03:44:44","2021-06-25 03:44:55","2021-06-25 03:44:44","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiK2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\5D7M5YAX\papers.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\W8RW5PJB\Barrientos and Kudebayeva - 2015 - Social Transfers and Women's Labour Supply in Kyrg.pdf","","","Kyrgyzstan; women; Social transfers; labour supply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2704450","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an  important socio-economic issue for our country because a) remittances are making up a  big share of GDP; b) women are a vulnerable group of people that need social protection,  especially outside the home-country. To protect women economically and socially and  develop policies for these purposes, government has to understand what motivates  women in our country to migrate.

Our results show that international migration had diverse effects on different sources of rural income in Kyrgyzstan. The effect of international migration in total was negative on crop income, but positive on livestock income and mixed for nonagricultural income. The positive effect of remittances on nonagricultural income implies that migration can promote diversification of rural households’ income sources.

In fact, the empirical evidence produced in this analysis confirms the presence of these two channels, suggesting that emigration affects negatively the development of the origin country. A discussion on the persistence of the phenomenon requires to explore its causes, since they may be related to either structural or short-term reasons. A crucial element in this regard is represented by the weakness of the labour market. On the one hand, the lack of vacancies enhances the incentive of people to migrate; on the other hand, informal jobs usually entail low social protection - due to unregular payments and the absence of an health insurance - and may push workers to leave the country and search for better working conditions, especially when the likelihood to find a formal job is very low.

We use household surveys collected before, during, and after the privatization reform and spatial variation in its timing to identify its health and nutrition impacts. We find that young children aged 0-5 exposed to land privatization for longer periods of time accumulated significantly greater gains in height and weight, both critical measures of long-term health and nutrition. Health improvements appear to be driven by increases in consumption of home-produced food—suggesting that increased private control over household production may translate into increased consumption and thus health dividends for young children.","2020-01-14","2021-06-24 17:12:49","2021-06-24 17:13:07","","","52","","","","","","","","","","Intl Food Policy Res Inst","","en","","","","","Google Books","","LiK2016","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=s-TJDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Public Policy / Agriculture & Food Policy; Social Science / Agriculture & Food","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After correcting for selection bias and other potential endogeneities with instrumental variables and fixed effects regressions, remittances are found to have negative impacts on human capital investment and educational achievement. The negative effects can be attributed in part to recipients’ increased expenditure on durable goods and extended hours of child labor on farm work as a compensation for missing adult labor. Our finding calls for actions that mitigate the negative effects and incentivize families to spend remittances on education, including financial literacy education, better monitoring of farm labor hours of school-age children, and targeted investment to improve the quality of education services in the Kyrgyz Republic.","2021-05-25","2021-06-24 17:09:00","2021-06-24 17:09:19","2021-06-24 17:09:00","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiK2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\RYJWFXC3\papers.html","","","household expenditure; Kyrgyz Republic; remittances; education; human capital investment; labor migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3849991","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then identify who precisely in the joint distribution of education and ethnicity is displaced by the conflict.

Empowerment indexes that are built from cross-country routine surveys are increasingly being developed, and further disaggregated analyses of such indexes are needed to examine in-depth, the relationship between women's empowerment and outcomes including children's nutrition. The Demographic and Health Surveys across five countries in South-Central Asia was used to examine the relationship between women's empowerment and children's nutrition outcomes. Empowerment was measured using the three domains (attitude to violence, social independence, and decision-making) in the Survey-based Women's emPowERment (SWPER) index. Main and interaction effects between the SWPER domains and women's wealth index were examined to check if there is a differential positive impact of empowerment for poorer women on children's nutrition outcomes. Outcome measures were children's height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height z-scores. Marginal effects of logistic regression and OLS were used to examine main effects and linear probability models and OLS for interaction effects. Analyses were cluster-adjusted, sample-weighted, and important control variables were included. Significance was established at 95% and 99% confidence intervals. In South-Central Asia, to reduce stunting wasting and underweight rates, empowering women through improving their social independence and decision-making power might be important. Furthermore, targeting poorer women for empowerment in social independence and decision-making appears to confer positive benefits towards the reduction of stunting, wasting, and underweight rates in children. However, the main and interaction effects of women's empowerment and wealth index on children's nutrition outcomes vary across the countries examined. These variations suggests that exogenous contextual factors might play a role in the empowerment-nutrition and empowerment-wealth-nutrition associations and interactions.","2021-03-01","2021-06-29 17:15:53","2021-06-29 17:16:04","2021-06-29 17:15:52","100718","","","13","","SSM - Population Health","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\5EHF8SUV\S2352827320303554.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\TFTHTVXB\Onah - 2021 - Women's empowerment and child nutrition in South-C.pdf","","","Central Asia; Nutrition; Children; South Asia; Women's empowerment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes poor-rich inequalities in the use of maternity care and seeks to understand these inequalities through comparisons with other types of health care. METHODS: Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 45 developing countries were used to describe poor-rich inequalities by wealth quintiles in maternity care (professional delivery care and antenatal care), full childhood immunization coverage and medical treatment for diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). FINDINGS: Poor-rich inequalities in maternity care in general, and professional delivery care in particular, are much greater than those in immunization coverage or treatment for childhood illnesses. Public-sector inequalities make up a major part of the poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery attendance. Even delivery care provided by nurses and midwives favours the rich in most countries. Although poor-rich inequalities within both rural and urban areas are large, most births without professional delivery care occur among the rural poor. CONCLUSION: Poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery care are much larger than those in the other forms of care. Reducing poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery care is essential to achieving the MDGs for maternal health. The greatest improvements in professional delivery care can be made by increasing coverage among the rural poor. Problems with availability, accessibility and affordability, as well as the nature of the services and demand factors, appear to contribute to the larger poor-rich inequalities in delivery care. A concerted effort of equity-oriented policy and research is needed to address the huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care.","2007-10","2021-06-29 17:12:02","2021-06-29 17:12:26","2021-06-29 17:12:02","745-754","","","85","","Bull World Health Organ","Huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care","","","","","","","en","","","","","SciELO","","DHS1997","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\BZHF8ZCT\en.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\XITSV2E3\Houweling et al. - 2007 - Huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care an .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We considered all Demographic and Health Surveys (starting with DHS round 3) conducted between 1993 and 2013 for which a final dataset was available in the public domain at the time of the analysis. Ever and current prevalence of home-based records for recording vaccination was estimated for children aged 12–23 months at the time of the survey through a secondary analysis of data from 180 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 67 countries derived from questions asked of women aged 15–49 years for their children on home-based record availability and retention. Ever home-based record prevalence is the proportion of children aged 12–23 months who have ever received a home-based record. Current home-based record prevalence is the proportion of children aged 12–23 months for whom a home-based record was available for viewing by the surveyor at the time of the survey. Results Estimated ever home-based record prevalence was ≥90% in 116 surveys from 52 countries and was <70% in 15 surveys from 7 countries. Estimated current home-based record prevalence was ≥80% in 31 surveys from 23 countries and was <50% in 51 surveys from 24 countries. Current home-based record prevalence was <80% as of the most recent survey during 2010–2013 for five (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Pakistan) of the ten countries with the largest birth cohorts globally. Among 34 countries that conducted three or more DHS, we observed improvements in both ever and current home-based record prevalence of >10% points in six countries. Current home-based record prevalence increased >10% points in six countries where the ever prevalence was maintained at ≥90% across the period of observation. And, no meaningful change was observed in estimated ever and current home-based record prevalence in 11 countries, five of which maintained ever prevalence ≥90% across the period of observation. High home-based record loss rates were observed in many countries. Conclusions The results here show that despite improvements in the availability, utilization and retention of home-based records for recording vaccination history in some countries, opportunities remain to change the mind-set in many national immunization programmes around the importance of the home-based record, particularly in countries with large birth cohorts. Immunization programmes are encouraged to monitor ever and current home-based record prevalence. Nationally representative household surveys collecting information on immunization coverage should include ever and current home-based record prevalence in the standard survey reports and tables to better enable programme managers to identify problems and target corrective action.","2015-05-21","2021-06-29 17:08:45","2021-06-29 17:08:58","2021-06-29 17:08:45","2584-2593","","22","33","","Vaccine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\254I8F7C\S0264410X15004405.html","","","Health records, Personal; Home-based record; Immunization; Immunization card; Immunization systems; Medical records; Monitoring; Record; Recording; Vaccination; Vaccination card","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (2005–2014) in 45 Gavi-supported countries, we measured inequalities in vaccination coverage across seven dimensions of social stratification and of vulnerability to poor health outcomes. We quantified inequalities using pairwise comparisons (risk differences and ratios) and whole spectrum measures (slope and relative indices of inequality). To contrast measurement approaches, we pooled the estimates using random-effects meta-analyses, ranked countries by the magnitude of inequality and compared agreement in country ranks. Results At the aggregate level, maternal education, multidimensional poverty, and wealth index poverty were the dimensions associated with the largest inequalities. In 36 out of 45 countries, inequalities were substantial, with a difference in coverage of 10 percentage points or more between the top and bottom of at least one of these social dimensions. Important inequalities by child sex, child malnutrition and urban/rural residence were also found in a smaller set of countries. The magnitude of inequality and ranking of countries differed across dimension and depending on the measure used. Pairwise comparisons could not be estimated in certain countries. The slope and relative indices of inequality were estimated in all countries and produced more stable country rankings, and should thus facilitate more reliable international comparisons. Conclusions Inequalities in vaccination coverage persist in a large majority of Gavi-supported countries. Inequalities should be monitored across multiple dimensions of vulnerability. Using whole spectrum measures to quantify inequality across multiple ordered social groups has important advantages. We illustrate these findings using an equity dashboard designed to support decision-making in the Sustainable Development Goals period.","2017-02-07","2021-06-29 17:07:50","2021-06-29 17:08:06","2021-06-29 17:07:50","951-959","","6","35","","Vaccine","Monitoring equity in vaccination coverage","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\EPARNSSZ\S0264410X1631266X.html","","","Developing countries; DTP3 coverage; Equity; Healthcare disparities; MCV coverage; Socioeconomic factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accumulative evidence from animal and human studies suggests that such deficiencies are associated with large adverse effects on child cognitive and motor development. Therefore, effective interventions to improve iron status will have large health benefits. Action to reduce young child ID would benefit from overarching policy and programmatic guidance that informs decision makers about what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. The impetus for new approaches to prevent ID in young children reflects growing recognition of the need to intervene early and often and for better vehicles to deliver iron. Prevention of ID requires strong delivery systems that enhance consumer demand and promote compliance. When this occurs, the prevalence of anemia is greatly reduced.","2008-12-01","2021-06-29 17:02:42","2021-06-29 17:03:10","2021-06-29 17:02:42","2523-2528","","12","138","","The Journal of Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","DHS1997","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\JFY2MSBT\4670189.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\XHGCIT2B\Lutter - 2008 - Iron Deficiency in Young Children in Low-Income Co.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The population under study was nursing students and health professionals.  Method: Data was collected within the framework of the Universalia Guidelines, using a range of methods, including a literature review, interviews with nurses and physicians, and observing nurses working at a hospital, and two institutions providing nursing education, the Medical College and the Kyrgyz State Medical Academy in Bishkek. Findings: Most nurses have a three-year diploma in nursing. However, nursing education is insufficient, lacks clinical training and is managed primarily by physicians. There are few opportunities for continuing education and one advanced five-year nursing degree program, which does not add much value to the three-year diploma. Qualified, nurses face additional challenges, including a lack of medical equipment, exclusion from planning and documentation of patient care and low salaries. Conclusion: Clinical practice of nursing students should be strengthened through the provision of direct supervision by nursing faculty with clinical expertise. Nursing education curricula should be reviewed by nursing experts to better prepare students for nursing practice. Sufficient clinical equipment should be provided to teaching facilities and hospitals; The salary scale of nurses should be improved; Nurses with the advanced five-year degree in nursing education and with clinical experience could be prepared for the role of nurse-educator; and the Ministry of Health and college/university administrators should provide the political will necessary to support nurses and nurse educators. Clinical Relevance: The findings will guide long-term planning and inform leaders, administrators and educators at nursing schools, and policy makers. It will improve planning and implementation of nursing education and practices and will ultimately improve the health care.","2017-03-01","2021-06-29 17:02:04","2021-06-29 17:02:26","","1-8","","","2","","International Journal of Nursing Papers","Nursing Education, Profession and Practice in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","DHS2012","","; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\DL5GL3UH\Somani and Karmaliani - 2017 - Nursing Education, Profession and Practice in Bish.pdf","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315050122_Nursing_Education_Profession_and_Practice_in_Bishkek_Kyrgyz_Republic_A_Situation_Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This grounded theory study gives voice to survivors of domestic violence by examining women’s experiences of various forms of violence and the complexities surrounding Kyrgyz women’s decision making about leaving violent relationships. Findings revealed that survivors move through a three-stage process of leaving: (a) reaching a turning point, (b) implementing the leaving process, and (c) reclaiming self. Participants described “turning points” as critical events or sudden realizations that the violence had become uncontrollable or intolerable, and that the problem was not going to be solved without external support. The turning points fell into four major categories, including epiphanies and moments of truth, losing hope for a change in the abuser’s behavior, reaching the point of saturation and giving up, and experiencing fear for the safety of children and protecting self. The main factor that led women to leave was being confronted with the pervasive fear that the abuse would lead to permanent disability or death. In the second stage, the process of leaving was characterized by an iterative cycle of leaving and returning until women were able to weigh the costs and benefits of staying and leaving in the face of cultural, institutional, and systemic constraints. The final stage of leaving involved “reclaiming self,” which was the result of cognitive shifts, finding new meanings in their experiences of abuse and attempts to leave, and support received from advocates at the shelter. Results have implications for interventions with survivors and policies addressing the problem of domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan.","2021-02-01","2021-06-29 16:57:56","2021-06-29 16:58:16","2021-06-29 16:57:56","1718-1744","","3-4","36","","J Interpers Violence","Leaving and Beyond","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","DHS2012","","","","","Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; leaving and empowerment; shelters; sociocultural context; violence against women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

National surveys since 1990 permit the calculation of estimates based on the standard definition used in the Demographic and Health Survey series, as well as alternative definitions. Methods: Fifty-five national surveys are used to estimate numbers and proportions of women with unmet need, according to marital status, spacing and limiting purposes, age and region. Results: In the developing world, an estimated 105.2 million married women have an unmet need. Unmarried women add 8.4 million, and the former Soviet republics add 9.1 million (of all marital statuses), for a total of 122.7 million. The proportion of married women in the developing world with an unmet need is 17%, lower than previously estimated because of a declining trend in many countries that reflects growing contraceptive use. For unmarried women, the proportion is 3%. Women aged 15-24 account for one-third of unmet need. Many women classified as having unmet need do not plan to use a method, but they are generally offset by women who want a child within two years yet still plan to use. Conclusions: The unmet need numbers reflect the upward pressures of population growth acting against the downward push of declining proportions with unmet need. The total estimate of 122.7 million women with unmet need represents a substantial and continuing challenge for agencies and governments concerned with ensuring access to contraceptives.","2002","2021-06-29 16:56:20","2021-06-29 16:57:05","2021-06-29 16:56:20","138-143","","3","28","","","Unmet Need for Contraception in the Developing World and the Former Soviet Union","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","DHS1997","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Proper separation requires accounting for competing risks of pregnancy outcomes. Objective: To measure the differential risk of spontaneous termination and induced abortion according to contraceptive use prior to pregnancy based on pooled Demographic and Health Survey calendar data. Methods: We use multinomial logistic models controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables to estimate the differential risk of spontaneous termination and induced abortion according to contraceptive use at the time of pregnancy. We address data limitations including recall error, omission error, and possible misclassiﬁcation of outcomes. Results: We find higher risk of induced abortion (RRR = 7.18, CI = 6.38–8.09) and spontaneous termination (RRR = 1.38, CI = 1.13–1.69) after contraceptive failure, with stronger effect for women under 30. Parity, union status, education, and wealth have a strong effect on induced abortion. Regarding spontaneous termination, age mainly explains the increased risk. Conclusions: Since pregnancies following contraceptive failure are less likely to end in a live birth, aggregate models of the impact of family planning should reﬂect that contraceptive use and induced abortion conform interdependent strategies and that spontaneous termination is a competing risk of induced abortion. Contribution: This is the ﬁrst study reporting differences in the risk of spontaneous termination and induced abortion according to contraceptive use prior to pregnancy. We account for competing risks using a multinomial logit model of pregnancy outcomes conditional on pregnancy, new in the literature.

The main aim of this study is to estimate the double burden of malnutrition among children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys (2001&ndash;2016). A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition indicators in 595,975 children under five years from 65 LMICs. Significant heterogeneity was detected among the various surveys (I2 &gt;50%), hence a random-effect model was used. Sensitivity analysis was also performed, to examine the effects of outliers. Results: The pooled estimate for stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight/obesity was 29.0%, 7.5%, 15.5%, and 5.3% respectively. Countries with the highest coexistence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity were: South Africa (stunting 27.4% (95% CI: 25.1, 29.8); overweight/obesity 13.3% (95% CI: 11.5, 15.2)), Sao Tome and Principe (stunting 29.0% (95% CI: 26.8, 31.4); overweight/obesity 10.5% (95% CI: 9.0, 12.1)), Swaziland (stunting 28.9% (95% CI: 27.3, 30.6); overweight/obesity 10.8% (95% CI: 9.7, 12.0)), Comoros (stunting 30.0% (95% CI: 28.3, 31.8); overweight/obesity 9.3% (95% CI: 8.3, 10.5)), and Equatorial Guinea (stunting 25.9% (95% CI: 23.4, 28.7); overweight/obesity 9.7% (95% CI: 8.0, 11.6)).

However, we know little about how interviewers might affect responses to survey questions on abortion. The aim of this study is to assess how interviewers affect the probability of women reporting abortions in nationally representative household surveys: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). We use cross-classified random intercepts at the level of the interviewer and the sampling cluster in a Bayesian framework to analyze the impact of interviewers on the probability of reporting abortions in 22 DHS conducted worldwide. Household surveys are the only available data we can use to study the determinants and pathways of abortion in detail and in a representative manner. Our analyses are motivated by improving our understanding of the reliability of these data. Results show an interviewer effect accounting for between 0.2% and 50% of the variance in the odds of a woman reporting ever having had an abortion, after women's demographic characteristics are controlled for. In contrast, sampling cluster effects are much lower in magnitude. Our findings suggest the need for additional effort in assessing the causes of abortion underreporting in household surveys, including interviewers' skills and characteristics. This study also has important implications for improving the collection of other sensitive demographic data (e.g., gender-based violence and sexual health).

Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, Wang investigates the determinants of health outcomes in low-income countries both at the national level, and for rural and urban areas separately. DHS data from more than 60 low-income countries between 1990 and 1999 reveal two interesting observations. First is the negative association between the level and inequality in child mortality. Second is the significant gap in child mortality between urban and rural areas, with the rural population having a much slower reduction in mortality compared with the urban population. Given that the poor are mainly concentrated in rural areas, the evidence suggests that health interventions implemented in the past decade may not have been as effective as intended in reaching the poor.","2002-04-26","2021-06-29 10:03:39","2021-06-29 10:03:55","2021-06-29 10:03:39","","","","","","","Health Outcomes in Poor Countries and Policy Options","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DHS1997","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\H287XF7C\papers.html","","","SSRN; Health Outcomes in Poor Countries and Policy Options: Empirical Findings from Demographic and Health Surveys; Limin Wang","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 636180","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of our findings were consistent with modernization theory in that increased levels of education, urbanization, and degrees of Russification of a household all had inverse relationships with likeliness of beshik usage.

"HZASIP9Z","journalArticle","2007","Barrett, Jennifer; Buckley, Cynthia","Constrained Contraceptive Choice: IUD Prevalence in Uzbekistan","International Family Planning Perspectives","","0190-3187","","https://www.jstor.org/stable/30039203","Context: Because individuals' and couples' needs vary, the availability of a variety of contraceptive choices is a key component of successful family planning programs. Most women in Uzbekistan rely on a single contraceptive method (the IUD), but it is unclear whether this reflects constraints on choice or simply a widespread preference. Methods: Nationally representative data from the 1996 Uzbekistan Demographic and Health Survey and the 2002 Uzbekistan Health Examination Survey were used to evaluate the relationship between demographic characteristics and knowledge and use of contraceptives among sexually active women. Separate multivariate regression analyses were performed for 1996 and 2002. Results: Nearly all sexually active women knew about contraceptives, and in 2002 most reported that they had ever used the IUD (71%) or any modern method (77%). In both surveys, women with higher levels of wealth (odds ratios, 2.2-3.1) and education (1.9-2.5) were more likely than other women to know about contraceptive methods other than the IUD. Higher levels of wealth and education, as well as urban residence and non-Uzbek ethnicity, were also associated with the use of contraceptives other than the IUD, although these relationships were generally weaker in 2002 than in 1996. Conclusion: Despite the high prevalence of contraceptive use in Uzbekistan, the country's reproductive health program may be constraining method choice. Expanded programmatic efforts emphasizing choice from a range of methods are needed, especially among subgroups of women who have little knowledge or experience with methods other than the IUD. /// Contexto: Tomando en cuenta que varían las necesidades de las personas y de las parejas, la disponibilidad de una diversidad de opciones de anticonceptivos es un componente clave para lograr que sean exitosos los programas de planificación familiar. La mayoría de las mujeres de Uzbekistán utilizan únicamente un método anticonceptivo (el DIU), aunque no se sabe con precisión si esto refleja limitaciones de elección o simplemente que hay una gran preferencia por este método. Métodos: Se utilizaron datos representativos obtenidos a nivel nacional, recopilados por la Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud de Uzbekistán, realizada en 1996 y por la Encuesta de Examen de la Salud de Uzbekistán de 2002, para evaluar la relación que existe entre las características demográficas y el conocimiento y uso de anticonceptivos entre las mujeres sexualmente activas. Se realizaron análisis independientes de regresión logística de multivariables, con los datos obtenidos en 1996y 2002. Resultados: Casi todas las mujeres sexualmente activas tenían conocimientos acerca de métodos anticonceptivos y en la encuesta de 2002 la mayoría indicó que alguna vez habían utilizado un DIU (71%) o algún otro método (77%). En ambas encuestas, las mujeres con mayor nivel económico (coeficientes de probabilidades de 2, 2-3, 1) y de educación (1, 9-2, 5) fueron más proclives que otras mujeres a tener un mayor conocimiento acerca de métodos anticonceptivos que no fuera únicamente el DIU. Los niveles económico y de educación más elevados, así como el lugar de residencia urbana, o su origen étnico, no uzbekistano, también fueron características que estuvieron relacionadas con el uso de otros anticonceptivos que no fueran el DIU; no obstante, estas relaciones fueron más débiles en la encuesta realizada en 2002 que en la de 1996. Conclusión: A pesar de la elevada prevalencia del uso de anticonceptivos en Uzbekistán, el programa de salud reproductiva de este país probablemente está limitando las opciones del uso de otros métodos. Es necesario que el programa amplíe y ofrezca una amplia gama de métodos, especialmente entre los subgrupos de mujeres que tienen pocos conocimientos o experiencia con otros métodos que no sea el DIU. /// Contexte: Face à la diversité des besoins des personnes et des couples, la variété des choix contraceptifs proposés est essentielle au succès des programmes de planification familiale. La plupart des femmes d'Ouzbékistan pratiquent une même méthode contraceptive (le stérilet), mais il n'est pas établi que ce choix reflète une sélection limitée ou, simplement, une préférence généralisée. Méthodes: Les données nationalement représentatives des enquêtes EDS 1996 et Health Examination Survey 2002 d'Ouzbékistan servent à évaluer le rapport entre les caractéristiques démographiques et la connaissance et pratique de la contraception parmi les femmes sexuellement actives. Des analyses de régression multivariées distinctes ont été effectuées pour 1996 et 2002. Résultats: Presque toutes les femmes sexuellement actives étaient au courant de la contraception. En 2002, la plupart ont déclaré avoir utilisé le stérilet (71%) ou une méthode moderne quelconque (77%). Dans les deux enquêtes, les femmes aux niveaux supérieurs de richesse (rapport de probabilités, 2, 2-3, 1) et d'instruction (1, 9-2, 5) se sont avérées plus susceptibles de connaître de méthodes contraceptives autres que le stérilet. Les niveaux supérieurs de richesse et d'instruction, de même que la résidence en milieu urbain et Vethnicité non-ouzbèque, étaient aussi associés à l'usage de contraceptifs autres que le stérilet, bien que ces rapports soient généralement plus faibles en 2002 qu'en 1996. Conclusion: Malgré la haute prévalence de la pratique contraceptive en Ouzbékistan, il se peut que le programme de santé génésique du pays entrave les choix de méthode. De vastes efforts programmatiques mettant l'accent sur le choix parmi différentes méthodes doivent être déployés, surtout parmi les sous-groupes de femmes dont la connaissance ou l'expérience des méthodes autres que le stérilet est faible.","2007","2021-06-29 09:40:26","2021-06-29 09:40:42","2021-06-29 09:40:26","50-57","","2","33","","","Constrained Contraceptive Choice","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","DHS1997","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analysed nationally representative data available from surveys or vital registration systems on the proportion of births by CS. We used local non-parametric regression techniques to correlate CS with maternal mortality ratio, infant and neonatal mortality rates, and the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel. Although very unevenly distributed, 15% of births worldwide occur by CS. Latin America and the Caribbean show the highest rate (29.2%), and Africa shows the lowest (3.5%). In developed countries, the proportion of caesarean births is 21.1% whereas in least developed countries only 2% of deliveries are by CS. The analysis suggests a strong inverse association between CS rates and maternal, infant and neonatal mortality in countries with high mortality levels. There is some suggestion of a direct positive association at lower levels of mortality. CS levels may respond primarily to economic determinants.","2007","2021-06-29 09:38:35","2021-06-29 09:38:57","2021-06-29 09:38:35","98-113","","2","21","","","Rates of caesarean section","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","DHS1997","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\JRP3AJF2\j.1365-3016.2007.00786.html","","","caesarean section; geographic variation; infant mortality; maternal mortality; neonatal mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the extent of tobacco use in pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unclear. We assessed the magnitude of tobacco use in pregnant women in LMICs. Methods We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) done in 54 LMICs between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 1, 2012, comprising 58 922 pregnant women (aged 15–49 years), which were grouped by WHO region. Prevalence of current tobacco use (smoked and smokeless) was estimated for every country. Pooled estimates by regions and overall were obtained from random-effects meta-analysis. Findings Pooled prevalence of any tobacco use in pregnant women in LMICs was 2·6% (95% CI 1·8–3·6); the lowest prevalence was in the African region (2·0%, 1·2–2·9) and the highest was in the Southeast Asian region (5·1%, 1·3–10·9). The pooled prevalence of current tobacco smoking in pregnant women ranged from 0·6% (0·3–0·8) in the African region to 3·5% (1·5–12·1) in the Western Pacific region. The pooled prevalence of current smokeless tobacco use in pregnant women was lowest in the European region (0·1%, 0·0–0·3) and highest in the Southeast Asian region (2·6%, 0·0–7·6).

Methods Using data from demographic health surveys (DHSs) conducted during 2010 to 2016, this paper explores the proportion of missed opportunities for vaccinations generally provided during routine immunization among children in their 2YL. Results DHS data in 46 countries surveyed 478,737 children, from which 169,259 children were 12–23 months old and had vaccination/health cards viewed by surveyors. From this group, 69,489 children aged 12–23 months had contact with health services in their 2YL. Three scenarios for a missed opportunity for vaccinations were analysed: (1) a child received one vaccine in the immunization schedule and was eligible for another vaccine, but did not receive any further vaccination, (2) a child received a vitamin A supplementation (VAS) and was due for a vaccine, but did not receive vaccines that were due, and (3) a child was taken to a health facility for a sick visit and was due (and eligible) for a vaccine, but did not receive the vaccine. A total of 16,409 (24%) children had one or more missed opportunities for vaccinations. Conclusion This analysis highlights the magnitude of the problem of missed opportunities in the 2YL. The global community needs to provide better streamlined guidance, policies and strategies to promote vaccination screenings at well-child and sick child visits in the 2YL. Where they do not exist, well-child visits in the 2YL should be established and strengthened.","2018-05-31","2021-06-29 09:16:58","2021-06-29 09:17:54","2021-06-29 09:16:58","3260-3268","","23","36","","Vaccine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\ZQKS5L2C\S0264410X18305772.html","","","Immunization; Vaccination; Missed opportunities; Second year of life; Service delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study design We conducted a retrospective analysis using contraceptive calendar data from Demographic and Health Surveys from 36 low- and middle-income countries from 2005 through 2014. The prevalence of contraception utilization and the contribution of each reason for contraceptive discontinuation was calculated, at country level as well as for the pooled dataset, for 10,901 women aged 15–49 before the current unintended pregnancies. Results Unintended pregnancies ranged from 5.5% of all pregnancies in the Kyrgyz Republic to 60.0% in Colombia and Peru. In Central Asian and in six African countries, over 80% of women with a current unintended pregnancy had not used any contraceptives in the previous five years. Use of long-acting modern methods remained consistently low across all countries. Among women who last used a traditional method, 83.8% discontinued due to failure. Among women who last used a long-acting modern method, 40.2% discontinued because of side effects. Conclusions Our findings confirm that more than 65.0% of women with an unintended pregnancy in 36 low and middle-income countries were either non-users or using traditional methods. An additional 31.2% were using short-acting modern methods. Long-acting methods would have prevented the overwhelming majority of unintended pregnancies. Implications This paper shows the need for the health system to support use of suitable methods, reduce switching failure and identify early when women are having concerns about the method they are using.","2020-01-01","2021-06-28 17:22:07","2021-06-28 17:22:25","2021-06-28 17:22:07","26-33","","1","101","","Contraception","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\Z94R5S6T\S0010782419304305.html","","","Family planning; Developing countries; Demographic health survey; Unwanted pregnancies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding differentials in levels of abortion according to women's characteristics can shed light on the circumstances surrounding the reasons leading to abortion. Methods: Data from government statistics, nationally representative sample surveys and subnational sources are used to estimate percentage distributions of abortions and abortion rates and ratios by selected characteristics of women, particularly age at abortion, marital status and parity. Comparisons are made within and across countries. Results: Women aged 40 and older generally obtain the lowest proportion of abortions (10% or fewer in most countries). Although adolescents account for a high proportion of abortions in some countries (for example, 33% in Cuba and 22% in Scotland), they do not obtain a disproportionate share of procedures. In general, abortion rates by women's age show an inverted U-shaped pattern. Abortion ratios by age, however, show two patterns: a U shape and a monotonic increase with age. In more than half of the countries studied, married women obtain a larger proportion of abortions than unmarried women. However, once pregnant, unmarried women are more likely than married women to choose abortion. More than half of abortions are obtained by women with at least one child. Some variations exist in these patterns by region. Conclusions: Women's characteristics influence their likelihood of terminating unintended pregnancies. However, within all demographic and socioeconomic subgroups, some women will obtain an abortion when faced with an unintended pregnancy.","1999","2021-06-28 17:18:34","2021-06-28 17:18:53","2021-06-28 17:18:34","68-77","","2","25","","","Characteristics of Women Who Obtain Induced Abortion","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","DHS1997","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WHO sexual and reproductive health (SRH) strategies were developed in the WHO Regional Office for Europe (2001), as well as globally (2004). Adolescent SRH is important in both strategies. Despite these commitments, adolescents remain vulnerable to poor reproductive health. The goal of this paper is to analyse the current status of SRH of adolescents in Europe.Methods Key reproductive health indicators were chosen. Information was obtained from published studies, databases and questionnaires sent to WHO reproductive health counterparts within the health ministries in the Member States of the WHO European Region.Results Pregnancy rate, age at first sexual intercourse, contraceptive use at first and last intercourse, contraceptive prevalence, HIV knowledge, and STI rates vary widely according to the population considered. Gender difference and lack of information pertaining to SRH of all adolescent populations are other key findings.Conclusions While the SRH of most European adolescents is good, they remain a vulnerable population.

The country has developed two major health reform programmes after becoming independent: Manas (1996 to 2006) and Manas Taalimi (2006 to 2010). These reforms introduced comprehensive structural changes to the health care delivery system with the aim of strengthening primary health care, developing family medicine and restructuring the hospital sector.Major service delivery improvements have included the introduction of new clinical practice guidelines, improvements in the provision and use of pharmaceuticals, quality improvements in the priority programmes for mother and child health, cardiovascular diseases, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, strengthening of public health and improvements in medical education. A Community Action for Health programme was introduced through new village health committees, enhancing health promotion and allowing individuals and communities to take more responsibility for their own health. Health financing reform consisted of the introduction of a purchaser provider split and the establishment of a single payer for health services under the state-guaranteed benefit package (SGBP). Responsibility for purchasing health services has been consolidated under the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund (MHIF), which pools general revenue and health insurance funding. Funds have been pooled at national level since 2006, replacing the previous pooling at oblast level. The transition from oblast-based pooling of funds to pooling at the national level allowed the MHIF to distribute funds more equitably for the SGBP and the Additional Drug Package. Although utilization of both primary care and hospital services declined during the 1990s and early 2000s, it is increasing again. There is increasing equality of access across regions, improved financial protection and a decline in informal payments, but more efforts will be required in these areas in the future.","2011-03-01","2021-06-28 17:15:57","2021-06-28 17:16:08","","xiii, xv-xx, 1","","","13","","Health systems in transition","Kyrgyzstan","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","MICS2005","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51242051_Kyrgyzstan_Health_system_review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Material and methods A secondary analysis of the latest cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys of six FSU countries from 2005 through 2012 was conducted. Prevalence of institutional births and unintended pregnancies was estimated by country and for the pooled population. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to measure the country and pooled association between pregnancy intention and institutional birth. Results Institutional births occurred in 90.4% of the overall study population and ranged from 78.2% in Tajikistan to 99.7% in Ukraine Demographic and Health Survey. Around one out of 10 pregnancies resulted unintended. In the pooled analysis, unintended pregnancies were significantly associated with giving births outside health facility (aOR1.2; 95% CI 1.0–1.6).

The DHS were initially designed to expand on demographic, fertility and family planning data collected in the World Fertility Surveys and Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys, and continue to provide an important resource for the monitoring of vital statistics and population health indicators in low- and middle-income countries. The DHS collect a wide range of objective and self-reported data with a strong focus on indicators of fertility, reproductive health, maternal and child health, mortality, nutrition and self-reported health behaviours among adults. Key advantages of the DHS include high response rates, national coverage, high quality interviewer training, standardized data collection procedures across countries and consistent content over time, allowing comparability across populations cross-sectionally and over time. Data from DHS facilitate epidemiological research focused on monitoring of prevalence, trends and inequalities. A variety of robust observational data analysis methods have been used, including cross-sectional designs, repeated cross-sectional designs, spatial and multilevel analyses, intra-household designs and cross-comparative analyses.

Using Demographic and Health Survey data from over 60 low-income countries, this study (1) presents global patterns of the level and inequality in child mortality and (2) investigates the determinants of child mortality, both at the national level and separately for urban and rural areas. The global patterns of health outcomes reveal two interesting observations. First, as child mortality declines, the gap in mortality between the poor and the better-off widens. Second, while child mortality in rural areas is substantially higher than in urban areas, the reduction in child mortality is much slower in rural areas where the poor are concentrated. This suggests that health interventions implemented in the past decade may not have been as effective as intended in reaching the poor. The analysis on mortality determination shows that at the national level access to electricity, incomes, vaccination in the first year of birth, and public health expenditure significantly reduce child mortality. The electricity effect is large and independent of the income effect. While in urban areas, access to electricity is the only significant mortality determinant, in rural areas, vaccination in the first year of birth is the only significant factor.","2003-09-01","2021-06-28 16:52:56","2021-06-28 16:53:12","2021-06-28 16:52:56","277-299","","3","65","","Health Policy","Determinants of child mortality in LDCs","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS1997","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\WFIYH228\S0168851003000393.html","","","Health inequality; Infant mortality; Under-five mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much remains unknown about factors that affect risk of IPV in transitional countries. Specifically, we explore risk factors for IPV among four former nations of the Soviet Union—Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Moldova—with data from the nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys. Rates of physical abuse were similar within Tajikistan (18.96%) and Moldova (18.38%), while Kyrgyzstan (20.62%) had the highest prevalence and Azerbaijan (9.29%) had the lowest prevalence. In contrast, the prevalence of sexual abuse was very similar across the four countries and was much lower (between 1.00% and 3.50%) than cross-national estimates of physical abuse. Findings suggest that many of the same risk factors of IPV in developing and developed nations influence risk of IPV in transitional nations. Across the four former Soviet nations included in analyses, the experience of controlling behaviors, husband’s alcohol use, and witnessing IPV or experiencing abuse during childhood were all significantly associated with risk of physical and sexual abuse later in life. Indeed, the intergenerational transmission of violence may be a cross-national phenomenon. In addition, equality in decision making did not have an effect on risk of physical and sexual violence, except for risk of physical abuse in Moldova. This may be due to the historical context of these nations. Taken together, findings suggest that country context may influence individual risk factors of IPV.","2021-03-01","2021-06-28 16:50:39","2021-06-28 16:50:53","2021-06-28 16:50:39","NP3346-NP3368","","5-6","36","","J Interpers Violence","Parts Unknown","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","DHS2012","","","","","intimate partner violence; intergenerational transmission of violence; transitional nations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The preschool years (ages 0-5) represents a point of opportunity for children to be active, develop healthy eating habits and maintain healthy growth. Surveillance of childhood overweight and obesity in this age group can help inform future policies and interventions. Objective: To review and report available prevalence data in WHO European Region Member States and determine how many countries can accurately report on rates of overweight and obesity in children under 5 years. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of studies reporting on overweight and obesity prevalence in children ages 0-5 in the WHO European region member states from 1998 to 2015. Results: 35 of the 53 member states have data providing prevalence rates for overweight and obesity for children under 5 years. There was little consistency in study methods, impacting comparability across countries. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children under 5 years ranges from 1% to 28.6% across member states.

Transitional societies offer a unique context for studying marital instability as they are often buffeted by countervailing forces of modernisation and re-traditionalisation, in addition to socio-economic and political changes. Using detailed and rich data from Kyrgyzstan, the study investigates trends over time in marital instability in response to societal upheavals and gradual secular transformations; ethnic group-specific responses in marital instability; and the role of changing gender regimes in marital instability. The findings reveal an increase in the rate of marital dissolution over time.

In this paper, a variety of data sources and methods are used to assess levels of infant mortality and their trend over time in one Central Asian republic, Kyrgyzstan, between 1980 and 2010. An abrupt halt to an already established decline in infant mortality was observed to occur during the decade following the break-up of the Soviet Union, contradicting the official statistics based on vital registration.

I examined the individual- and community-level factors associated with spousal violence in post-Soviet countries.Methods. I used population-based data from the Demographic and Health Survey conducted between 2005 and 2012. My sample included currently married women of reproductive age (n = 3932 in Azerbaijan, n = 4053 in Moldova, n = 1932 in Ukraine, n = 4361 in Kyrgyzstan, and n = 4093 in Tajikistan). I selected respondents using stratified multistage cluster sampling. Because of the nested structure of the data, multilevel logistic regressions for survey data were fitted to examine factors associated with spousal violence in the last 12 months.Results. Partner’s problem drinking was the strongest risk factor associated with spousal violence in all 5 countries. In Moldova, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, women with greater financial power than their spouses were more likely to experience violence. Effects of community economic deprivation and of empowerment status of women in the community on spousal violence differed across countries. Women living in communities with a high tolerance of violence faced a higher risk of spousal violence in Moldova and Ukraine. In more traditional countries (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan), spousal violence was lower in conservative communities with patriarchal gender beliefs or higher financial dependency on husbands.Conclusions. My findings underscore the importance of examining individual risk factors in the context of community-level factors and developing individual- and community-level interventions.","2015-11-01","2021-06-28 16:28:08","2021-06-28 16:28:26","2021-06-28 16:28:08","e12-e22","","11","105","","Am J Public Health","Spousal Violence in 5 Transitional Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","ajph.aphapublications.org (Atypon)","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\858FLRE9\AJPH.2015.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\GWHBLPMC\Ismayilova - 2015 - Spousal Violence in 5 Transitional Countries A Po.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the current literature also suggested pro-poor distribution of vaccination in some countries, including the Gambia, the Kyrgyz Republic and Namibia. This study aimed to explain socioeconomic inequalities in the completion rate of the four-core vaccines (i.e., Bacille Calmette-Guérin [BCG], diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP, 3 doses], Polio [3 doses] and Measles vaccines) in the three aforementioned countries. We used the most recent available Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) to measure vaccination completion rates among children (aged 0–59 months, n = 16,752) in the three countries. The normalized concentration index (Cn) was used to quantify and decompose socioeconomic inequalities in vaccination coverage in each country. The negative values of the Cn index suggested that children belong to lower socioeconomic status groups were more likely to be immunized than their higher socioeconomic status counterparts in the Gambia (Cn = −0.101, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.128 to −0.074), the Kyrgyz Republic (Cn = −0.097, 95% CI: −0.13 to −0.063) and Namibia (Cn = −0.161, 95% CI: −0.199 to −0.124). The decomposition analysis of the Cn suggested that the difference in child vaccination completion rates between rural and urban areas was the main factor contributing to the concentration of child vaccination among the poor in the Gambia and Namibia. The concentration of child vaccination among the poor in the Kyrgyz Republic was chiefly determined by household wealth. These results suggest that there should be strategies to improve child immunization uptake among urban children in the Gambia and Namibia. Since household wealth was the main factor contributing to the observed pro-poor distribution of child vaccination in the Kyrgyz Republic, further studies are required to understand the reasons for lower vaccination rate among the wealthy children in order to implement the most effective strategies to increase child vaccination uptake.","2019-10-16","2021-06-28 16:27:33","2021-06-28 16:27:44","2021-06-28 16:27:33","6609-6616","","44","37","","Vaccine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\CY4CZZR4\S0264410X19312769.html","","","Child vaccination; Determinants; Developing country; Inequalities; Socioeconomic status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to present the reasons women give for obtaining induced abortions in 14 countries. Study design We examined nationally representative data from 14 countries collected in official statistics, population-based surveys, and facility-based surveys of abortion patients. In each country, we calculated the percentage distribution of women who have abortions by main reason given for the abortion. We examined these reasons across countries and within countries by women's sociodemographic characteristics (age, marital status, educational attainment, and residence). Where data are available, we also studied the multiple reasons women give for having an abortion. Results In most countries, the most frequently cited reasons for having an abortion were socioeconomic concerns or limiting childbearing. With some exceptions, little variation existed in the reasons given by women's sociodemographic characteristics. Data from three countries where multiple reasons could be reported in the survey showed that women often have more than one reason for having an abortion. Conclusion This study shows that women have abortions for a variety of reasons, and provides a broad picture of the circumstances that inform women's decisions to have abortions. Implications Future research should examine in greater depth the personal, social, economic, and health factors that inform a woman's decision to have an abortion as these reasons may shed light on the potential consequences that unintended births can have on women's lives.","2017-10-01","2021-06-28 16:11:51","2021-06-28 16:12:14","2021-06-28 16:11:51","233-241","","4","96","","Contraception","Reasons why women have induced abortions","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DHS2012","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\UIHQSBPS\S0010782417301889.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\F5YQDIZL\Chae et al. - 2017 - Reasons why women have induced abortions a synthe.pdf","","","Induced abortion; Multiple countries; Reasons; Unintended pregnancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abortion has been one of the major reproductive health concerns in post-Soviet nations, especially when it is commonly used as a means of fertility regulation. On average, every woman has had around 1.6 abortions in Kyrgyzstan. This paper attempts to measure the role of abortion in fertility regulation using data from the Kyrgyz Republic Demographic and Health Survey (KRDHS), 1997. The analysis reveals that Kyrgyzstan can attain replacement level fertility in the absence of induced abortion by raising the contraceptive prevalence to 70% at the current level of effectiveness. The study also shows that women's attitude towards becoming pregnant and their partner's perception about abortion are significantly associated with the propensity to opt for an induced abortion.

But how may these expectations be formed? Using Life in Transition survey data for a large set of transition economies and several Western European countries, this paper examines the link between beliefs about the importance of personal connections for getting access to opportunities, such as a good job or university education, and expectations of future socioeconomic mobility. The analysis of survey data finds evidencethat: (i) lack of connections is associated with expectations of a lower position on the future social ladder; and (ii) when informal connections are unavailable, it matters for your aspirations whether you perceive connections to be vital or not. There is also some evidence that in the European Union, where formal institutions are stronger, individuals are less likely to resort to informal institutions such as personal connections, even when these are available. Perceptions of unequal access to opportunities are also linked with stronger redistributive preferences. Finally, there is some evidence that unequal access to opportunities is associated not only with lower intragenerational mobility, but also with lower intergenerational mobility.","2019-02-05","2021-07-15 16:55:22","2021-07-15 16:55:39","2021-07-15 16:55:22","","","","","","","Inequality of Access to Opportunities and Socioeconomic Mobility","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiT2010","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\ZGXS53M7\papers.html","","","Educational Sciences; Inequality; Labor Markets; Natural Disasters; Poverty Assessment; Poverty Diagnostics; Poverty Impact Evaluation; Poverty Lines; Poverty Monitoring & Analysis; Small Area Estimation Poverty Mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3335092","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CW7MQUUV","book","2009","","Satisfaction with Life and Service Delivery in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union: Some Insights from the 2006 Life in Transition Survey","","978-0-8213-7900-4","","","","The past two decades in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have been times of tremendous change, with countries undergoing rapid transformation from centrally-planned to market-oriented economies. While poverty increased during the initial years of transition, primarily on account of the sharp economic contraction, the resurgence of economic growth in the region since 1998 has resulted in a rebound in household incomes and living standards. Data from the 2006 Life in Transition Survey (LiTS)a joint initiative of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bankprovides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent to which citizens of ECA countries are satisfied with their lives and with the performances of their governments, and to study key factors influencing their outlook in a systematic way across all countries of the region.The main objective of the LiTS was to assess the impact of transition on people, covering four main themes. First, it collected personal information on aspects of material well-being, including household expenditures, possession of consumer goods such as a car or mobile phone, and access to local public services and utilities. Second, the survey included measures of satisfaction and attitudes towards economic and political reforms as well as public service delivery. Third, the LiTS captured individual 'histories'key events and episodes that may have influenced their attitudes towards reforms, and information on family background, employment, and coping strategies. Finally, the survey also attempted to capture the extent to which crime and corruption are affecting peoples' lives, and the extent to which individuals' trust in other people and in state institutions has changed over time.","2009","2021-07-15 13:33:10","2021-07-15 13:33:25","","","112","","","","","Satisfaction with Life and Service Delivery in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","LiT2006","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=dyQZJIr4CMkC","","Business & Economics / Development / Business Development; Medical / Health Care Delivery; Political Science / Public Policy / Social Services & Welfare; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing from a unique monthly panel survey called Listening to the Citizens of Uzbekistan and a survey experiment, this paper focuses on two factors that prevent domestic mobility: (i) restrictive propiska registration policies, and (ii) the exceptionally high cost of urban housing. Registration rules prohibit migration to urban centers, and urban housing costs push up the cost of living to as much as 550 percent of the national average, levels severely unaffordable for almost all rural residents. But the proposed government reforms in 2019 to address these challenges are very popular. The results show that about 90 percent of people support lifting all registration restrictions and over 80 percent favor increasing urban housing construction. The results of the experiment show that reform popularity increases when propiska rules and housing costs are referenced in randomly assigned vignettes. However, views may also be sensitive to perceptions of fairness. Recent high-profile involuntary demolitions coincided with a doubling of the share responding that policies are unfair. The increase was further associated with declining optimism and lower support for the wider government national development program, beyond urbanization issues.","2020-01-13","2021-07-15 13:31:55","2021-07-15 13:32:09","2021-07-15 13:31:55","","","","","","","Free Movement and Affordable Housing","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","L2TJK","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\WPB2WIPI\papers.html","","","Educational Sciences; Inequality; Consumption; Fiscal & Monetary Policy; Housing & Human Habitats; Municipal Management and Reform; Urban Governance and Management; Urban Housing; Urban Housing and Land Settlements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3516367","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large literature finds that stunting and undernutrition in early childhood are commonly the result of several contributing environmental, food, hygiene, and health-related factors. However, quantifying these interactions is usually not possible due to the difficulty of collecting sufficient data on each dimension in a single survey. To address this issue, we integrated the samples of two separate nationally representative surveys conducted simultaneously in Tajikistan in late 2016. This design allows analysis of the determinants of undernutrition in a unified framework. The results show strong associations between undernutrition and the number of food calories consumed, food diversity, access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, access to health services, and care practices. Consistent with previous studies, the results also show that overlapping adequacies are associated with much reduced stunting risk. The findings suggest that: i) nutrition interventions addressing multiple risk factors may promote better outcomes than focusing on any single deprivation, ii) there is need for programs addressing food inadequacy, both in the form of the number of calories consumed and the diversity of food consumed, iii) promoting food adequacy alone is likely not sufficient to generate large reductions in malnutrition, and iv) interventions should predominantly focus on rural areas where risks of malnutrition are substantially higher.","2017-11","2021-07-15 11:36:13","2021-07-15 11:36:32","2021-07-15 11:36:10","","","","","","","","","","","","World Bank, Washington, DC","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","L2TJK2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\66A2ITID\Lavado et al. - 2017 - Childhood Stunting in Tajikistan.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To narrow this knowledge gap, this paper examines their impact on the domestic labor market, using the case of Tajikistan – a labor migrant contributor and remittance dependent country in Central Asia. Specifically, we estimate the impact of international migration and receipt of remittances on the labor supply decisions and employment of the family members left behind. To ensure rigorous inferences, we apply a control function approach using unique high-frequency household panel data. Our method enables us to correctly address the simultaneity of migration/remittance and labor supply decisions of the left-behind members. Our main estimates are that sending migrants reduces the labor supply of the left-behind members by 5.4 percentage points, and that receiving remittances reduces it by 10.2 percentage points, respectively. These findings suggest that the reservation wage effect of having a migrant member and receiving remittances is large and surpasses other positive effects they might have.","2021-04-01","2021-07-15 11:30:41","2021-07-15 11:31:09","2021-07-15 11:30:41","101268","","","73","","Journal of Asian Economics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","L2TJK2015","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\PSAEIIUJ\S1049007820301482.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\QCPM2DCD\Murakami et al. - 2021 - The impact of migration and remittances on labor s.pdf","","","Central Asia; Remittances; Migration; Tajikistan; Endogenous switching; Labor market participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To quantify the effects of government taxation and social spending on measures of poverty and inequality in Tajikistan, we use the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Assessment method with data from a survey called Listening to Tajikistan (2015) and fiscal data from administrative sources over the same period. We find that fiscal policy in Tajikistan contributes to an increase in the poverty rate (at the $US PPP 3.20 per person per day poverty line) by 5.12 percentage points. The results also show that the fiscal system achieves some modest redistribution despite a relatively small social expenditure budget. Although some transfers are well-targeted in Tajikistan, direct and indirect taxes fall heavily on poorer households and offset the poverty-reducing effect of public expenditures. The size of the main targeted social assistance program is insufficient to either remarkably reduce poverty or compensate for tax contributions among the poorest households. The findings suggest that social expenditures intended for the poor do not in practice reach their targets, and expenditures on universal services such as education and health care are spread evenly across the population. The strongest options for greater redistribution to support poor and vulnerable households include i) improved targeting of public expenditures, ii) greater progressivity by redesigning tax policy to collect a larger share of revenue from higher income people, and iii) larger transfer budgets for the best targeted expenditures such as Targeted Social Assistance (TSA).","2021-02","2021-07-15 09:26:57","2021-07-15 09:27:20","2021-07-15 09:26:57","","","","","","","","","","","Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Working Paper Series","Tulane University, Department of Economics","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","L2TJK2015","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\Y8362PMI\108.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\TNKG7MBX\Benicio et al. - 2021 - The Effects of Fiscal Policy on Poverty and Inequa.pdf","","","Taxation; Poverty; Tajikistan; Fiscal Incidence; Fiscal Policy and Inequality; Income Inequality; Social Assistance; Social Spending","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper argues that strong economic governance and institutions are important elements in improving financial inclusion especially for the poor segment of the society because markets, economic activity, and transactions more generally, cannot function well in their absence. The results suggest that governance positively influences financial inclusion by increasing the number of bank accounts and saving in formal financial institutions, but negatively impacts on borrowing behavior. There are also significant differences across countries and regions in explaining financial inclusion. The study suggests that removing corruption, increasing transparent legal framework, fair judicial proceedings and good administration are essential for development and raising financial inclusiveness prospects.","2017","2021-07-14 13:45:17","2021-07-14 13:45:38","2021-07-14 13:45:17","","","","","","","The Impacts of Governance and Institution on Financial Inclusion","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","GFI2014","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\B3F7M5C4\papers.html","","","Development; Financial Inclusion; Financial Markets; Governance; Institutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3061390","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it has been argued by some authors that the rise in personal remittance inflows to these countries could be leveraged for more inclusive finance. In this essay, we examine whether remittances have provided additional avenues for policymakers to promote financial inclusion. Although some case studies have explored the potential link between remittances and households’ demand for financial services, no cross-country analysis has yet been carried out for empirical tests. We use data from the World Bank Global Findex database (Demirguc-Kunt et al., The Global Findex Database 2011: measuring financial inclusion and the Fintech revolution. The World Bank, Washington, 2011) on financial inclusion for 107 remittance-receiving countries to examine whether remittances contribute to inclusive finance. Contrary to the findings from earlier case studies, our results show that remittance inflows have a significant negative impact on financial inclusion by reducing the demand for deposit accounts from formal financial institutions. However, our results are consistent with the earlier findings that remittances do not have a significant and robust impact on the demand for credit instruments from formal institutions. These results continue to hold when the data are disaggregated for the rural sector. More importantly, the partial effects of remittances are found to be non-linear across countries.","2019","2021-07-14 12:17:03","2021-07-14 12:17:13","2021-07-14 12:17:03","91-108","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","GFI2011","","","","","","Hall, Joshua C.; Harper, Sara","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, a fast-growing amount of literature has emerged to examine its measurement, determinants and impacts. Governments have made the promotion of it a priority. For example, the World Bank’s 2014 Global Financial Development Report (GFDR), devoted to financial inclusion, reports that more than two-thirds of regulatory and supervisory agencies have been tasked with encouraging financial inclusion, and more than 50 countries have set formal targets. Last year, the World Bank President announced a global target of universal financial access by 2020. Defined as the share of the population who use financial services, financial inclusion has proven to be linked to desirable economic outcomes above and beyond those associated with the more familiar concept of financial depth. In this chapter, we analyse the existing country-level information on both financial inclusion and the penetration or presence of Islamic banking in order to ascertain the extent to which Islamic banking has contributed to financial inclusion. This chapter tests for a possible financial inclusion of Islamic banking relationships across a wide variety of measures. Our findings suggest a weak and tentative evidence of Islamic banking’s positive impact on some types of inclusion. This weakness in the results may be partially related to data issues, including the limited coverage of Islamic banking indicators and of financial inclusion indicators among the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries.</p>","2017-01-27","2021-07-14 11:31:40","2021-07-14 11:32:23","2021-07-14 11:31:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","www.elgaronline.com","","GFI2014???","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\SRPAK5IX\9781784710729.00017.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data, drawn from the Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database, highlight the existence of significant gender gaps in ownership of accounts and usage of savings and credit products. Even after controlling for a host of individual characteristics including income, education, employment status, rural residency and age, gender remains significantly related to usage of financial services. This study also finds that legal discrimination against women and gender norms may explain some of the cross-country variation in access to finance for women. The analysis finds that in countries where women face legal restrictions in their ability to work, head a household, choose where to live, and receive inheritance, women are less likely to own an account, relative to men, as well as to save and borrow. The results also confirm that manifestations of gender norms, such as the level of violence against women and the incidence of early marriage for women, contribute to explaining the variation in the use of financial services between men and women, after controlling for other individual and country characteristics.","2013-04-01","2021-07-14 08:25:29","2021-07-14 08:25:42","2021-07-14 08:25:29","","","","","","","Financial Inclusion and Legal Discrimination Against Women","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","GFI2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\8UVK4N8T\papers.html","","","Access to Finance; Financial Literacy; Gender and Development; Gender and Law; Population Policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2254240","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"F5CWJMVE","book","2013","Group, World Bank","Global Financial Development Report 2014: Financial Inclusion","","978-0-8213-9985-9","","","","Financial inclusion has become a major subject of interest among policymakers, researchers, and other financial sector stakeholders. Many countries, for example, have recently adopted explicit financial inclusion strategies with targets for financial inclusion. The interest reflects an increased recognition that financial inclusion can be a driver of economic growth and poverty alleviation, and that many individuals and firms are excluded unnecessarily from even basic financial services. About half of the world’s adult population— more than 2.5 billion people—have no bank account is one powerful example. Barriers such as cost, travel distance, and amount of paperwork and requirements play an important role. Many of these barriers can be addressed by better policies. Despite the high interest, there are still important gaps in knowledge about financial inclusion, what drives it, and what policies affect it. And while recent years have seen some increases in financial inclusion, there is still much scope to reduce barriers to access. However, one of the challenges is that efforts to increase inclusion, if not implemented well, can backfire. Deeply ingrained social problems cannot be resolved purely with an infusion of debt. If not done properly, it can have the opposite effect, making poor borrowers increasingly dependent on debt, and even contributing to financial instability. Global Financial Development Report 2014: Financial Inclusion is a new report from the World Bank Group. It takes a step back and re-examines financial inclusion from the perspective of new global datasets and new evidence. It builds on a critical mass of new research and operational work produced by World Bank Group staff as well as outside researchers and contributors. The report, the second in this series, follows up on the inaugural issue, the Global Financial Development Report 2013: Rethinking the Role of the State in Finance (http://www.worldbank.org/financialdevelopment). Accompanying the Global Financial Development Report 2014 is a vast body of underlying research and data. Among other things, this includes an expanded and updated version of the Global Financial Development Database, a dataset of over 70 financial system characteristics for 203 economies from 1960 to 2011, which is presented in the report’s appendix.","2013-11-07","2021-07-14 08:24:12","2021-07-14 08:24:23","","","226","","","","","Global Financial Development Report 2014","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","GFI2014","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=GEcXAgAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Business & Economics / Finance / General; Business & Economics / International / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main method of research is a sociological survey on the level of use of financial technologies in the Republic of Tajikistan. In addition, we used the methods of systematization, generalization and graphical presentation of the data to analyze the results of the survey. The levels of use of financial technologies by men and women were compared; it has been found that they vary significantly. In addition, there is a gap in the understanding and use of financial technologies depending on the place of residence (urban/rural). The expansion of digital financial services can, therefore, identify opportunities for continuation and challenges that need to be addressed in promoting women's financial inclusion and economic empowerment.","2019","2021-07-14 08:19:08","2021-07-14 08:19:29","","12","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","GFI2017","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\X6DAJA7X\Makhkamova and Saidmurodov - 2019 - FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGIES AS A FACTOR OF FINANCIAL IN.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though bride kidnapping has always been illegal, it has been routinely practiced throughout history. The process involves various actors at different stages, including a groom and his male friends, and his female and male relatives. The role of female relatives is significant in this process.  By helping the groom, these women facilitate and contribute to the continuation of this illegal practice.  Even though there is a growing body of literature on bride kidnapping, few studies have explored the roles of women facilitators of bride kidnapping. In fact, there is no study that specifically targets women facilitators, and little is known about their motives and perceptions of bride kidnapping. Knowing more about this topic is essential as bride kidnapping as it is practiced today could not continue without their involvement. As such, through a qualitative interview of women facilitators, my research is aimed at exploring the motivational factors and how these women facilitators understand their involvement in bride kidnapping and this practice in general. The study suggests six themes emerged based on the findings and provides recommendations for future research and policy.","2021","2021-07-06 18:25:17","2021-07-06 18:25:43","2021-07-06 18:25:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en_US","","Thesis","","","krex.k-state.edu","","GSPS2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\SGTX35SU\Sadykova - 2021 - The role of women facilitators of bride kidnapping.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3KTHAI5W\41348.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This grounded theory study gives voice to survivors of domestic violence by examining women’s experiences of various forms of violence and the complexities surrounding Kyrgyz women’s decision making about leaving violent relationships. Findings revealed that survivors move through a three-stage process of leaving: (a) reaching a turning point, (b) implementing the leaving process, and (c) reclaiming self. Participants described “turning points” as critical events or sudden realizations that the violence had become uncontrollable or intolerable, and that the problem was not going to be solved without external support. The turning points fell into four major categories, including epiphanies and moments of truth, losing hope for a change in the abuser’s behavior, reaching the point of saturation and giving up, and experiencing fear for the safety of children and protecting self. The main factor that led women to leave was being confronted with the pervasive fear that the abuse would lead to permanent disability or death. In the second stage, the process of leaving was characterized by an iterative cycle of leaving and returning until women were able to weigh the costs and benefits of staying and leaving in the face of cultural, institutional, and systemic constraints. The final stage of leaving involved “reclaiming self,” which was the result of cognitive shifts, finding new meanings in their experiences of abuse and attempts to leave, and support received from advocates at the shelter.

In closely examining a range of issues--from the college campus rape epidemic in the United States to the climate change effects in Ghana--this book compels readers to utilize a contextual framework in order to take a closer look into contemporary violence and oppression against women in our world. Written through the lens of transnational feminism, it examines the intersections of nationhood, race, gender, sexuality, and economics within the context of a world shaped by globalization and colonialism, causing the redefinition of borders and the realignment of migration patterns. A transnational feminist perspective also supports a definition of global sisterhood based on equity, understanding, and mutual experiences. Students focusing on social justice, social work, women's studies, feminist theory, and/or violence against women will find the book to be an invaluable resource.","2019-10-03","2021-07-06 18:21:09","2021-07-06 18:21:19","","","473","","","","","Women's Journey to Empowerment in the 21st Century","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","GSPS2016","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=_x2yDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Social Work; Social Science / Women's Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Remarkable survey data from the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan enable exploration of differential birth outcomes for women in kidnap-based and other types of marriage using both OLS and IV estimation.

Drawing on ethnographic material, I illustrate how virginity is glorified and fetishised in ceremonies and rituals within practices recognised as re-constituted national traditions. I problematise such performances for their desexualising and dehumanising features and associated physical and sexual violence, torture and forced marriage inflicted upon young women. It is argued that these controversial practices have gained specific political significance after collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and have become inherent to the post-independence concept of Kyrgyz citizenship. State national identity politics has endorsed traditionalising of social norms utilising the rhetoric of restoring pre-Soviet authentic Kyrgyz lifestyle. The discourse promoting traditional women’s features such as chastity, purity and domesticity became central to national identity politics and practices emerged to uphold these narratives and protect these qualities. Virginity ceremonies are one such practice, which by the virtue of its link to post-independence concepts of ethnicity, gender identity and national identity receive much of their legitimacy.","2020-08-17","2021-07-06 18:18:38","2021-07-06 18:18:51","2021-07-06 18:18:38","706-716","","6","29","","","Re-feminizing the post-soviet women","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","GSPS2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\G72JYN7I\09589236.2020.html","","","Kyrgyzstan; women; identity; gender; nation; virginity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted in one such setting, Armenia, I examine public perceptions of various consequences of migration with what I define as a double-gendered analytic lens: looking at female and male migration through women’s and men’s eyes. The statistical tests find that overall female migration tends to be assessed more negatively than male migration, but they also point to instructive gender differences in such assessments. Thus, in general, men tend to see female migration more negatively and male migration more positively, compared to women. Yet, while this gender divide is consistently present in views on various consequences of male migration, it is not statistically noticeable in views on the effects of female migration on family duties and relationships or on sexual matters after controlling for other factors. These patterns illustrate the gendered complexity of public attitudes toward international labour migration and help to understand its dynamics and prospects in this and similar migrant-sending contexts.","2020-08-19","2021-07-06 18:17:42","2021-07-06 18:17:56","2021-07-06 18:17:42","1-24","","0","0","","","Double gendered","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","GSPS2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\QGV8AEMX\1369183X.2020.html","","","Armenia; gender; transitional societies; Labour migration; public opinion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many regard this practice as harmless elopement or a tradition; others perceive it as a form of forced marriage. OBJECTIVE This paper contributes to the understanding of ala kachuu by exploring the extent to which couples in these marriages differ from those in arranged or love marriages. METHODS We use the 2013 wave of the Life in Kyrgyzstan survey to compute profile similarity indices for the personality of couples. We then regress marriage type on the profile similarity index, controlling for sociodemographic variables. RESULTS Couples in marriages resulting from bride capture are far less assortatively matched on personality traits than other couples, especially those who have only recently married. CONCLUSIONS This greater dissimilarity is consistent with ala kachuu being forced marriage rather than merely staged or ritualized elopement. CONTRIBUTION This paper provides a novel source of evidence on the possible nonconsensual nature of bride capture in Kyrgyzstan, adding further weight to those arguing that it is forced.","2019","2021-07-06 18:17:06","2021-07-06 18:17:18","2021-07-06 18:17:06","579-592","","","41","","","How marriages based on bride capture differ","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","GSPS2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\IA8XM54G\Steiner and Becker - 2019 - How marriages based on bride capture differ Evide.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings show that people's satisfaction with democracy primarily depends on their perception of the representation function, and to a lesser degree on the accountability function.

However, recent events suggest that the existential and ontological insecurity promoted by globalization may have triggered a religious resurgence in national elections. The present paper offers the first comprehensive empirical test of the two rival expectations. We further hypothesize that the emergence of these competing outcomes (demise or resurgence of the religious vote) depends on the structure of the religious economy: established churches are better positioned for a political resurgence. The analysis combines individual-level data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems with two types of country-level information: globalization indices and a measure of local religious competition. Our results suggest that globalization may be linked to stronger religious-voting patterns in national elections especially under an established church.

"WYKT62EQ","book","2014","Thomassen, Jacques","Elections and Democracy: Representation and Accountability","","978-0-19-102563-1","","","","Elections and Democracy addresses the contrast between two different views on representative democracy. According to the first view elections are a mechanism to hold government accountable. In the second view elections are primarily a means to ensure that citizens' views and interests are properly represented in the democratic process. The majoritarian and consensus models of democracy are the embodiment in institutional structures of these two different views of democracy. In the majoritarian view the single most important function of an election is the selection of a government. The concentration of power in the hands of an elected majority government makes it accountable to the people. In consensus models of democracy, or proportional systems, the major function of elections is to elect the members of parliament who together should be as representative as possible of the electorate as a whole. The criterion for the democratic quality of the system is how representative parliament really is. The book explores how far these different views and their embodiment in institutional structures influence vote choice, political participation and satisfaction with the functioning of democracy. The volume is based on data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), a comparative study across 36 countries. The general conclusion of the book is that formal political institutions are less relevant for people's attitudes and behavior than often presumed. Rather than formal political institutions like the electoral system it seems to be characteristics of the party system like polarization and the clarity of responsibility that really matter. The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) is a collaborative program of research among election study teams from around the world. Participating countries include a common module of survey questions in their post-election studies. The resulting data are deposited along with voting, demographic, district, and macro variables. The studies are then merged into a single, free, public dataset for use in comparative study and cross-level analysis. The set of volumes in this series is based on these CSES modules, and the volumes address the key theoretical issues and empirical debates in the study of elections and representative democracy. Some of the volumes will be organized around the theoretical issues raised by a particular module, while others will be thematic in their focus. Taken together, these volumes will provide a rigorous and ongoing contribution to understanding the expansion and consolidation of democracy in the twenty-first century.

However, a number of recent studies—many using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)—demonstrate that this relationship varies according to individual- and election-level factors. In this paper, we introduce for the first time gender as a modifier of the effect of winning on satisfaction. We advance a theoretical argument about why gender, independent of its many correlates, should shape the extent to which electoral victory induces satisfaction. Specifically, we argue that the winning effect should be smaller for women than for men because of (1) gender-based differences in political socialization and (2) gaps in the symbolic connection with candidates and parties. Given this, we also expect that the gender gap in satisfaction is moderated by women's descriptive representation. To test our expectations, we use surveys from Modules I-IV of the CSES coupled with macro-level data sources. Results indicate a robust and precisely estimated gender-based disparity in the impact of winning on satisfaction, with its magnitude being comparatively small among women. This gap is smaller where women are well represented in the legislature, though the gender of the chief executive does not play a conditioning role.","2021-02-01","2021-07-06 17:51:49","2021-07-06 17:52:07","2021-07-06 17:51:49","102205","","","69","","Electoral Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","CSES2006","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\XAIX4BY2\S0261379420300883.html","","","Satisfaction with democracy; Descriptive representation; Gender; Winning and losing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mortality disadvantage of ethnic Russians at adult ages appears to have even increased since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The most common explanation for this “Russian mortality paradox,” is that deaths are better reported among ethnic Russians. In this study, we use detailed mortality data from Kyrgyzstan between 1959 and 1999 to evaluate various explanations for the Russian mortality paradox: data artifacts, migration effects, and cultural effects. We find that the most plausible explanation is the cultural hypothesis because the personal behaviors that appear to generate a large part of the observed mortality differences (alcohol consumption, in particular) seem to be closely tied to cultural practices. We examine the implications of this finding for understanding the health crisis in post-Soviet states.","2011-05-27","2021-07-06 17:26:09","2021-07-06 17:26:33","2021-07-06 17:26:09","1081-1104","","3","48","","Demography","Understanding the “Russian Mortality Paradox” in Central Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","PMS1998","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\DHK4GL93\Understanding-the-Russian-Mortality-Paradox-in.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\I898MEW4\Guillot et al. - 2011 - Understanding the “Russian Mortality Paradox” in C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, economists have  long recognized that a household’s sense of well-being depends not just on its average income or  expenditures, but also on the risks it faces and its ability to deal with these risks. Hence vulnerability is a  more satisfactory measure of welfare. In this study we used the concept of vulnerability as expected  poverty to assess the household vulnerability to poverty in four Central Asian countries: Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Except for Tajikistan, headcount poverty and vulnerability rates  are significantly different. We also find that vulnerability differs significantly across households by  location and selected household characteristics. In this paper we use a simple empirical measurement that  allows estimating the headcount vulnerability to poverty using cross-section data. This measurement is  based on the strong assumption that households have the same conditional distribution of consumption  in a stationary environment. While this approach cannot capture all dimensions of vulnerability, it at least  begins to raise the policy issue that vulnerability should be considered alongside poverty.","2009-11-09","2021-07-06 17:24:13","2021-07-06 17:24:32","2021-07-06 17:24:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","http://eaces.liuc.it/infonew.asp?tipo=scope ""The author will be able to re-publish the work in every format with the only constraint to acknowledge the first publication."" … and ""The copyright of the published papers will remain with their authors, who will be requested always to mention The European Journal of Comparative Economics as the original venue of publication.""   - from journal web site (as at 12/05/10)","","","","openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au","","PMS1998","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\RG7QFITE\Jha and Dang - 2009 - Vulnerability to poverty in selected Central Asian.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\MLEQRHPF\994.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This analysis is undertaken using the Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Survey, which is the only survey to date that allows a comprehensive analysis of poverty and labour market outcomes in the Kyrgyz Republic. The period under investigation covers the years 1997 to 1998, for which data are available. The results point to the extreme vulnerability of individuals with less education and women, who cumulated a high risk of being unemployed, of remaining longer in unemployment, of being discouraged unemployed and, if employed, of being low-paid or working in precarious jobs. Other groups facing a high risk of exclusion, both from and within employment, were people with disabilities, individuals living in rural or depressed areas, young people and internal migrants. The multiple aspects of vulnerability in the Kyrgyz labour market, in particular the large overlap between work and poverty, have important implications for the design of effective social policies.","2005","2021-07-06 17:13:17","2021-07-06 17:13:34","2021-07-06 17:13:17","409-430","","4","39","","","Jobless or Working Poor in the Kyrgyz Labour Market","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","PMS1998","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\9R4VDSKH\j.1467-9515.2005.00447.html","","","Poverty; Employment; Household surveys; Unemployment; Vulnerable groups; Wage determination; Working conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This essay argues that people are more likely to trust strangers and members of out-groups when governments recognize minority languages. How this effect manifests depends on the type of recognition afforded to the minority language in the education system and whether the individual speaks a majority or minority language at home. First, when the recognition afforded is of low cost, this has a positive effect on trust levels for those in the majority via the contact mechanism, but such superficial overtures are not sufficient to make a difference for those in the minority. Second, when the recognition afforded is one of high cost, the benefits of contact for the majority are now muted by tensions over funding priorities. However, for minority language speakers, such substantive policies acknowledge their cultural importance. These arguments are evaluated using data from Wave 6 of the World Values Survey (2010-2014).","","2021-07-06 17:10:04","2021-07-06 17:10:36","","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","WVS2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\CWYHLDJL\Liu et al. - Minority Language Recognition and Trust.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I suggest a new, more robust approach using data from the World Values Survey to establish worldwide trends in attitudes. The resulting analysis shows there has been some decline in trust in media since the early 1990s, but there is no evidence of a decline among stable democracies.

The expansion of Internet use across the world has given rise to the idea that television is nearing its end, and thus new participatory behaviors may be expected. However, there is no global perspective concerning such claims. This study tests such claims by analyzing actual media use around the globe for information seeking. Using data from Wave 6 of the World Values Survey (WVS) across 56 countries, this study finds that more people use television daily for information-seeking purposes compared to the Internet. This is also true for individuals who use the Internet daily; however, the reverse is not true―even for developed countries. Therefore, it appears that television still takes the lead across many countries when it comes to seeking information regarding everyday political life.

We then ask ourselves whether or not active, practicing Roman Catholics, who attend Church Services each Sunday (in Catholic jargon the Dominicantes) are more or less tolerant than overall society concerning our chosen five tolerance indicators. For the 59 states of the world there are complete data. While e.g. in Sweden and the United States 30% or less of the population have no confidence in people with a religious denomination other than their own, these percentages in Algeria; Armenia; Yemen; Kyrgyzstan; Libya; Morocco; Mexico; Palestine (occupied territories); Peru; Romania; Tunisia; and Uzbekistan are over 70% each. Among the ten states with the lowest general religious tolerance, based on our five indicators, there are nine predominantly Muslim states.

Using measures of self-rated health and subjective well-being from Wave 6 (2010–2014) of the World Values Survey, we examine the individual and social factors that shape older adulthood in 57 countries. In addition to examining inequalities in health and well-being for older adults between countries, we examine the differences between older (50 and over) and younger adults (under 50) within countries. Aging well is not simply a fact of country wealth or personal income. We conduct multi-level analyses to determine which individual-level factors and which country-level factors impact health and well-being, and how these differ across age. We consider three sets of country-level factors: material conditions, culture, and societal disruptions. Overall, we find that older adults feel less healthy than younger adults, but older adults in countries that have experienced a transition to independence during their adulthood feel much less healthy than their under-50 counterparts.

National borders and traditional religions cannot keep people in tidy boxes as political struggles, doctrinal divergences, and demographic trends are sweeping across regions and entirecontinents. And secularity is increasing in society, with a growing number of people in many regions having no religious affiliation or lacking interest in religion. Simultaneously, there is a resurgence of religious participation in the politics of many countries. How might these diverse phenomenabe better understood? Long-reigning theories about the pace of secularization and ideal church-state relations are under invigorated scrutiny by scholars studying secularism with new questions, better data, and fresh perspectives. The Oxford Handbook of Secularism offers a wide-ranging and in-depth examination of this global conversation, bringing together the views of an international collection of prominent experts in their respective fields. This is the essential volume for comprehending the core issues and methodologicalapproaches to the demographics and sociology of secularity; the history and variety of political secularisms; the comparison of constitutional secularisms across many countries from America to Asia; the key problems now convulsing church-state relations; the intersections of liberalism, multiculturalism, and religion; the latest psychological research into secular lives and lifestyles; and the naturalistic and humanistic worldviews available to nonreligious people.","2017","2021-07-06 17:00:51","2021-07-06 17:01:03","","","793","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","WVS2011","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=vC6hDQAAQBAJ","","Religion / Atheism; Religion / Religion, Politics & State","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings indicate that the widely noted decline in media trust is not a universal trend; it is true for only about half of the studied countries, with the United States experiencing the largest and most dramatic drop in trust in the press. Political trust has emerged as key factor for our understanding of trust in the press. We found robust evidence for what we called the trust nexus—the idea that trust in the news media is strongly linked to the way publics look at political institutions. The link between press trust and political trust was considerably stronger in politically polarized societies. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the relation between press trust and political trust is becoming stronger over time. We reason that the strong connection between media and political trust may be driven by a growing public sentiment against elite groups.","2018-01-01","2021-07-06 16:59:31","2021-07-06 16:59:40","2021-07-06 16:59:31","3-23","","1","23","","The International Journal of Press/Politics","Caught in the Nexus","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","WVS2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\FGPV82E5\Hanitzsch et al. - 2018 - Caught in the Nexus A Comparative and Longitudina.pdf","","","media trust; comparative analysis; political trust; press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also an integral component of positive and negative peace and a basic foundation of social justice. However, personal safety has been understudied in psychological literature, as has its role as an antecedent of well-being and social justice. To address this, the current study provided evidence for the association of personal safety with positive life outcomes. Analyses were conducted using data from 59 countries via the World Values Survey. After controlling for subjective socioeconomic status, significant positive associations were observed between personal safety and increased: (H1) self-flourishment, operationally defined as subjective happiness, satisfaction with life, and subjective health; (H2) perceived freedom in one’s life; (H3) perceived fairness in one’s life; (H4) active membership within a local community; and (H5) increased trust in others. An examination of the effect of victimization as a stressor of personal safety was also conducted, with personal victimization (H6), and the victimization of a family member (H7), both acting as stressors of personal safety in most of the countries. Replication rates among the 59 countries were higher for hypotheses H1 and H6–H7. Replication rates for hypotheses H2–H5 were also observed but toq a lower degree, with higher percentages observed in western and English-speaking countries. Personal safety is a crucial component of our society, worthy of further and more comprehensive investigations.

Evidence from World Values Survey (2010-2014)","","","","","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3466230","Based on macro-level observations that high religiosity is associated with lower economic growth, it is generally assumed that religiosity contributes to poverty. However, this conjecture may not be true because religion provides motivation to the poor, encourages cooperation in society, and influences preferences and habits in ways that could help reduce poverty. The present paper uses data from World Values Survey (WVS) covering 52 countries and 74,042 individuals, to construct a measure of multidimensional poverty based on deprivation counting approach and a measure of religiosity based on faith deprivation. It then addresses three questions: (a) Is religiosity similar among multidimensional-poor and non-poor? (b) Are there any differences in dimensions of deprivations among high religiosity and low religiosity people? (c) What is the impact of religiosity on multidimensional poverty? It finds that higher religiosity is associated with lower multidimensional poverty; faith-poor are more deprived in their protections of intellect and posterity than protections of life and wealth. A decrease in religiosity increases multidimensional poverty. An implication of the study is that a religious society would be less poor even if its economic growth is slow.","2019","2021-07-06 16:54:14","2021-07-06 16:54:30","2021-07-06 16:54:14","","","","","","","Does Religiosity Affect Multidimensional Poverty?","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","WVS2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\T5YGK8RI\papers.html","","","Poverty; Maqāṣid al-Sharīʿah; Multidimensional poverty; Religion; Religiosity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3466230","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To some extent it reveals the extraordinary potential of scientific research. The common feature of all our Yearbooks, including the present volume, is the usage of formal methods and social studies methods in their synthesis to analyze different phenomena. In other words, if to borrow Alexander Pushkin&#39;s words, ‘to verify the algebra with harmony’. One should note that publishing in a single collection the articles that apply mathematical methods to the study of various epochs and scales – from deep historical reconstruction to the pressing problems of the modern world – reflects our approach to the selection of contributions for the Yearbook. History and Mathematics, Social Studies and formal methods, as previously noted, can bring nontrivial results in the studies of different spheres and epochs.This issue consists of three main sections: (I) Historical and Technological Dimensionsincludes two papers (the first is about the connection between genes, myths and waves of the peopling of Americas; the second one is devoted to quantitative analysis of innovative activity and competition in technological sphere in the Middle Ages and Modern Period); (II) Economic and Cultural Dimensions (the contributions are mostly focused on modern period); (III) Modeling and Theories includes two papers with interesting models (the first one concerns modeling punctuated equilibria apparent in the macropattern of urbanization over time; in the second one the author attempts to estimate the number of Communicative Civilizations).We hope that this issue will be interesting and useful both for historians and  mathematicians, as well as for all those dealing with various social and natural sciences.","","2021-07-06 16:53:45","2021-07-06 16:53:57","","","240","","","","","History & Mathematics","","","","","ООО ""Издательство ""Учитель""","","en","","","","","Google Books","","WVS2011","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=YZB8DwAAQBAJ","","Mathematics / History & Philosophy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the relation between the threshold and the amount of land owned is positive in the case of continuous supply of land and negative when there is discontinuous supply of land. The direct consequence is that, in the first case, smaller farms will be more willing to rent land and exercise the option where, in the second case, larger farms will exercise first.

The analysis is based on household-level survey data, and uses a variety of econometric methods including instrumental variable techniques, to examine the impacts of migration and remittances in relation to a number key aspects of human development in the two countries; remittance motivations and altruism; their effects on poverty and inequality; and their relationship to household wealth, education and health. There is strong evidence of positive effects in relation to each of these. These findings indicate that where formal social protection systems are largely absent, migration and remittances can perform a similar function informally, contributing significantly to development objectives such as those of the Millennium Development Goals. From a policy perspective these informal mechanisms might best be left alone rather than introducing measures to incorporate them into the formal financial systems.","","2021-07-02 07:01:12","2021-07-02 07:01:27","","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","RPCA2007","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\THA2UN34\Brown - REMITTANCES AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PACIFIC EFFECT.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A 10% increase in remittances as a share of GDP leads to a 0.9-1.2% increase in GDP growth. The findings also show that remittances only have a negligible effect on the overall poverty rate, but they tend to decrease the poverty gap and thereby ameliorate the depth of poverty. The estimates suggest that a 10% increase in remittances decreases the poverty gap by about 0.7-1.4%.

Remittances can be used to maintain the household's standard of living by providing income to families with unemployed and underemployed adult members. Remittances can also be used to promote investment not only in businesses and communities but also in people. In this paper, we examine the role that remittances have played in the Kyrgyz Republic in promoting investments in children. Based on the capabilities approach to well-being initiated by Sen (2010), we look at the impact of remittances and domestic transfer payments primarily from internal migration on children's education and health. Our outcomes include enrollment in school and preschool, expenditures, stunting and wasting of preschool children, and health habits of older children. We use unique panel data from the Kyrgyz Republic for 2005-2008 and thus control for some of the biases inherent in cross-sectional studies of remittances and family outcomes. We find that overall remittances and domestic transfers have not promoted investments in the human capital of children. Specifically, preschool enrollments were higher in the urban north but secondary school enrollments were lower in other regions in remittance receiving households; expenditures were also negatively affected in the south and the mountain areas. These negative enrollment results were larger for girls than for boys. We also found evidence of stunting and wasting among young children and worse health habits among boys in remittance or transfer receiving households. In the long run, Kyrgyzstan needs human capital development for growth; our results suggest that remittances are not providing the boost needed in human capital to promote development in the future.","2012-02-04","2021-07-02 06:57:51","2021-07-02 06:58:13","2021-07-02 06:57:51","","","","","","","Remittances and Children's Capabilities","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","RPCA2007","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\NKSIKBD3\papers.html","","","Central Asia; remittances; children's education and health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 1999321","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A significant part of this growth comes from home owners installing rooftop photovoltaic. Despite this key role, most long-term model-based scenarios do not consider decentralized supply of rooftop photovoltaic but concentrate on utility-scale photovoltaic instead. In this paper, we implement rooftop photovoltaic in the Integrated Assessment Model IMAGE to study its possible role in energy and climate scenarios. We first calculated the global technical and economic potential to derive regional cost-supply curves for rooftop photovoltaic. Next, we have added a new decision in the IMAGE model allowing household investment in rooftop photovoltaic based on the comparison of the whole-sale electricity price with the price of rooftop photovoltaic. The global suitable roof surface area was assessed at 36 billion m2, or 4.7 m2 capita−1, leading to a potential for rooftop photovoltaic of 8.3 PWh y−1, roughly 1.5 times the 2015 global residential electricity demand. In the baseline scenario, adding rooftop photovoltaic could lead to a 80–280% increased share of photovoltaic electricity production in 2050 (i.e. from 6% to 17% in total power production). This increase depends on regional characteristics that are essential to the deployment of rooftop photovoltaic: differences in social-economic and policy factors (capital costs, household income, and electricity prices) are considerably more important than physical factors, such as solar irradiance.","2020-12-01","2021-07-01 15:24:15","2021-07-01 15:24:28","2021-07-01 15:24:15","115705","","","279","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","CPHK2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\H8FG89EG\S0306261920312009.html","","","BIPV; Building integrated photo-voltaic; Cost-supply curves; Integrated assessment model; Residential; Rooftop PV; Technical and economic potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They provide essential public services, build and operate key infrastructure, and are often reservoirs of public employment. Their characteristics and inherent competitive advantages as publicly owned enterprises allow them to play these critical roles. Their weaknesses in governance and inefficiencies in incentive structures, however, also often lead to poor performance. SOEs must be efficient, transparent, and accountable to level the playing field for private companies, secure the growth of a vibrant private sector, and achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth. This book analyzes the reform of SOEs in Asia, the results of which are mixed. The volume concludes that some key conditions generally need to be met for SOE reforms to be successful: national bureaucracies must have the capacity to implement the reforms, and adverse impacts on international trade and investment must be avoided.","2021","2021-07-01 15:21:15","2021-07-01 15:21:26","","","347","","","","","Reforming State-Owned Enterprises in Asia","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","Google Books","","JSM2013","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=AOUfEAAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study has assessed the empirical evidence for such a claim in the case of Bangladesh by evaluating unique employer-employee matched labor market data. The analysis is based on data collected from 6,981 workers in 500 formal sector firms in Bangladesh's five largest formal economic sectors. Using ordinary least squares and firm fixed-effect models, the study assesses correlations between wages and the so-called ""big five"" personality traits, and augments the analysis with the latent personality scores captured by the Rasch model. Comparing the ordinary least squares and fixed-effect models reveals statistically significant correlations between personality traits and wages, within and across firms. The results appear to indicate that non-cognitive skills are correlated with a worker's likelihood of achieving success in the labor market. Although many of the findings are consistent with the literature, the analysis reveals specific patterns that appear to be unique to Bangladesh, including a positive correlation between ""emotional stability"" and wages and a negative correlation between ""grit"" and wages, especially among manufacturing workers. Differences across firms could indicate that firms that offer higher wages may tend to attract workers with distinct types of non-cognitive skills, whereas differences within firms may indicate that variations in non-cognitive skills are associated with disparities in firm-level wage structures. Correlations between wages and personality traits are more prominent among large firms than among small or medium-sized firms.","2017-05-04","2021-07-01 15:18:27","2021-07-01 15:18:38","2021-07-01 15:18:27","","","","","","","The Influence of Non-Cognitive Skills on Wages within and between Firms","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","JSM2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\R2YI9ANE\papers.html","","","Education For All; Education for Development (superceded); Educational Populations; Rural Labor Markets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2963439","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The UEE reform improves governance in only one step, if a key one, in the long process to access and complete higher education: this report uses an original stakeholder assessment conducted in March and April 2014 as well as a recent nationally representative household survey to examine other steps to access and complete higher education and give voice to stakeholders' perspectives on the new reform. Tajikistan's education system is undergoing potentially transformative change. This report presents the findings of a Technical Assistance to the Government of Tajikistan that conducted a stakeholder assessment and used nationally representative household data to examine: (1) barriers to accessing and completing higher education in Tajikistan, and (2) how these barriers could change with the UEE reform. The assessment was conducted before the implementation of the UEE reform in six communities and five universities. To enable comparative analysis, a standardized package of data collection instruments was applied in the field. The instruments feature gender- and generation-specific focus group discussions (FGD) and semi-structured individual interviews with the users of education services: high school and university students, parents, and out-of school youths. In addition, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with education providers: high school teachers and university professors.

While they are an important source of foreign currency for low-income countries, the impact of outmigration and remittances on the economic development of the sending country is ambiguous. To narrow this knowledge gap, this paper examines their impact on the domestic labor market, using the case of Tajikistan – a labor migrant contributor and remittance dependent country in Central Asia. Specifically, we estimate the impact of international migration and receipt of remittances on the labor supply decisions and employment of the family members left behind. To ensure rigorous inferences, we apply a control function approach using unique high-frequency household panel data. Our method enables us to correctly address the simultaneity of migration/remittance and labor supply decisions of the left-behind members. Our main estimates are that sending migrants reduces the labor supply of the left-behind members by 5.4 percentage points, and that receiving remittances reduces it by 10.2 percentage points, respectively. These findings suggest that the reservation wage effect of having a migrant member and receiving remittances is large and surpasses other positive effects they might have.","2021-04-01","2021-07-01 15:15:23","2021-07-01 15:15:37","2021-07-01 15:15:23","101268","","","73","","Journal of Asian Economics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","JSM2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\93TW7MZD\S1049007820301482.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\VQ36L78C\Murakami et al. - 2021 - The impact of migration and remittances on labor s.pdf","","","Central Asia; Remittances; Migration; Tajikistan; Endogenous switching; Labor market participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology employed is a switching probit model that accounts for the endogeneity and self-selection of migration and remittance with respect to school enrollment. Counterfactual situations are constructed for children belonging to households with and without migrants, remittance receiving and nonreceiving households, and households with migrant parents to single out the impact of migration and remittances. The results show that migration of household members reduces the probability of enrolling in school by 10 percentage points for children who belong to households with migrants. The effect of parental migration is much larger than that of migration of other household members. Receiving remittances reduces the adverse impact of migration by only 1-3 percentage points.

"GF55MWLE","webpage","2014","","The skills road: skills for employability in Tajikistan","","","","","http://www.worldbank.org/","This report addresses a fundamental question facing policy makers in Tajikistan: is the current level of worker skills hindering employment outcomes? Using a unique household survey, the study finds that skills are valued in Tajikistan’s labor market, yet skills gaps persist. Jobs have been created in more knowledge-intensive occupations and in the service sector as opposed to the more traditional manual jobs, and employment outcomes are stronger for workers with better skills. Analysis of worker skills shows that workers with better cognitive and non-cognitive skills are typically more likely to have the highly sought-after formal sector jobs; and in fact make more frequent and intense use of mathematics and reading skills on the job. Furthermore, workers with better non-cognitive skills tend to become supervisors. The study finds that there are large variations in observed skills among those with the same level of educational attainment, indicating that formal education is failing too many people even though skills are developed during different stages in the life cycle and a host of actors are involved—families, for example, play a central role. The report’s conclusion is that the government could shift the focus from providing access to educational institutions and instead focus on providing the skills (cognitive, non-cognitive, and technical) students need to succeed as adults. The government can also do more to get children off to the right start by investing in early childhood development programs, where rates of return to investment are generally very high and important soft skills are learned. Finally, more can be done to match worker skills with employer demand by improving the use of information in matching skills to jobs in the labor market.","2014-09","2021-07-01 14:58:22","2021-07-01 14:58:35","2021-07-01 14:58:22","","","","","","","The skills road","","","","","","","en","cc_by","Monograph","","","","","JSM2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\AQAKQH7Q\2014 - The skills road skills for employability in Tajik.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\Z9W378JT\60024.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to extend existing evidence by investigating the link between cognitive skills and income in Tajikistan. Tajikistan is a landlocked low-income country situated in Central Asia. Its population is 9.1 million people and gross domestic product per capita of US$822. According to the World Bank, Tajikistan has made significant progress in decreasing poverty levels from 83% in 2000 to 29.5% in 2017. Design/methodology/approach The data for this study comes from the 2013 Jobs, Skills and Migration Survey conducted by the World Bank and the German Society for International Cooperation. The main explanatory variable of the study is the cognitive abilities index of the respondents. The survey used item response theory (IRT) approach to estimate the ability of respondents. IRT is a method or a set of statistical frameworks, used to explore assessment item data, such as cognitive abilities assessment data. The wage function was estimated using the ordinary least squares method because the results are easier to interpret (Jencks, 1979; Bowles et al., 2001; Groves, 2006). Findings The baseline results are reported in Table 2. The results in Column 1 demonstrated the link between cognitive abilities and income without control variables (unconditional model). As expected, cognitive abilities are positively and significantly related to income (a1 = 0.0715, p < 0.01). The results from the unconditional model suggest that one standard deviation increase in cognitive abilities is associated with a nearly 17% increase in income. Research limitations/implications However, the study has a number of limitations. First, the dependent variable measures the overall income of the respondent, which includes the profit from other businesses. The survey does not provide data on monthly wages of respondents. Second, the sample may not perfectly represent the overall population of Tajikistan. To partially resolve this issue, this paper re-estimated out results for various sub-samples. Another important limitation of this study is the lack of respondent’s family background, which is an important correlate of human capital and income. Practical implications The results in the study offer preliminary evidence on the link between cognitive abilities and income in Tajikistan. However, the results of the study also suggest that both measures of human capital are positively related to income. Therefore, policymakers in Tajikistan should invest greater resources to health care, education and training programs as cognitive skills can be built in particular in the early stages of the life cycle. Indeed, Tajikistan has a significant potential for economic growth model driven by human capital. According to the World Bank, the adult literacy rate in Tajikistan is 100%, which is significantly above of what is observed in other developing countries. This may imply that the human potential in this country is considerable, and further investment in soft and hard skills would have a positive impact on economic growth. Originality/value This paper offers new evidence on the link between cognitive abilities and income, using data from Tajikistan. First, this paper finds that cognitive abilities are positively and significantly correlated with income. Second, this paper finds that this link remains robust even when this paper control for a large set of personal and job-related characteristics. The results from the unconditional model suggest that one standard deviation increase in cognitive abilities is associated with nearly a 17% increase in income.","2020-01-01","2021-07-01 14:55:36","2021-07-01 14:55:52","2021-07-01 14:55:36","62-73","","1","20","","","Cognitive abilities and income","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","JSM2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\KHHYK44S\html.html","","","Tajikistan; Cognitive ability; Income","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The job satisfaction is analyzed using cross-sectional data from Jobs, Skills and Migration Survey conducted in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in 2013. Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are both lower-middle-income countries with economies mainly dependent on remittances from migrants working abroad. Today both these Central Asian countries practice higher level of external migration, and this labor outflow can be caused by lower level of job satisfaction which, in turn, induced by other factors that are needed to be determined. The main objective of this paper is to find out these determinants of job satisfaction in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Many studies have examined job satisfaction in overall by failing to take into account that job satisfaction is heterogeneous phenomenon since while people assess their job satisfaction extent, they might mean different things. Therefore, in this research we distinguish six types of job satisfaction as: job satisfaction in overall, job satisfaction in terms of work environment, job satisfaction in terms of earnings, job satisfaction in terms of hours, workload and breaks flexibility, job satisfaction in terms of working hours per day and job satisfaction in terms of social security affiliation status. To find out the main factors that significantly affect on job satisfaction of individuals working in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, ordinal logit and probit regression models are used. The findings of this research paper are estimated to be that gender, sector, working hours per week, expectation of income change, job security, health condition, paid sick leave, learning new things, and job routine have a significant relationship with job satisfaction.","2019","2021-07-01 14:54:55","2021-07-01 14:55:08","2021-07-01 14:54:55","","","","","","","Determinants of Job Satisfaction","","","","","","","","","Thesis","","","mt.osce-academy.kg","","JSM2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\NYSCI2EJ\31.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this new normal economic structure, the rapid progress of aging is increasing the necessity and desire for asset accumulation. In addition, digital finance such as Fin-tech with the evolution of the underlying technologies and the emergence of new technologies has replaced or improved many functions of existing finance in the advent of the 4th industrial revolution era.  Considering the situation that the degree of development of Fintech in each member is expanding financial inclusion, it is necessary for Korean financial companies to set up an advancement strategy that focuses on the financially marginalized class based on the advanced system strategy of credit rating based on big data.

To draw multi-dimensional results, we have set up the panel data for 45 countries, and we estimated the generalized method of moments (GMM), two-stage least squares (2SLS), panel vector autoregressive (VAR) and panel Granger causality tests. Based on the results of dynamic panel estimations, we find that FII has a positive effect on economic growth. The findings of Granger causality analysis reveals a bi-directional causality of FII indicators with economic growth and a unidirectional causality between the FII and economic growth. Therefore, it suggests that the financial inclusion index has a positive effect on the economic growth in IsDB member countries. These findings recommend that the policymakers should consider financial inclusion as a driver of the economic growth in the long run.

This theoretical treatment is then complemented with the third part of the chapter where a case study of Akhuwat Foundation, a Pakistani Islamic microfinance organization operating on a Qard Hassan model is presented in some detail and its relative success in breaking the cycle of poverty through Qard Hassan is highlighted.","2017","2021-07-01 11:56:47","2021-07-01 11:56:57","2021-07-01 11:56:47","141-197","","","","","","Financial Inclusion and Poverty Alleviation in Muslim-majority Countries","Palgrave Studies in Islamic Banking, Finance, and Economics","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","GFI2011","","","","","C83; D03; E22; Financial intermediation; Financing constraints; G30; Investment models; Islamic countries; O16","Zulkhibri, Muhamed; Ismail, Abdul Ghafar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an important objective in developing countries and a priority policy in industrialized countries. The aim of this paper is to outline the financial inclusion through different countries. The research is developed analyzing data published by the Global Findex Database in 2011, and applying a Cluster Analysis that carries out typologies of clusters of countries which are homogeneous inside but heterogeneous between them. The results of this research put in evidence a certain proximity among developing countries, which haven’t an inclusive financial system, and industrialized countries that have an inclusive financial system.","","2021-07-01 11:55:32","2021-07-01 11:55:42","","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","GFI2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\4JRCJWM3\Adamo et al. - An outline of financial inclusion through countrie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The book also includes summary pages by region and by income group aggregates. Covering 148 economies, the indicators of financial inclusion measure the use of formal bank accounts, payments behavior, savings patterns, credit patterns, and insurance decisions. Access to financial services play a critical part in development by facilitating economic growth and reducing income inequality. Inclusive financial systems allow poor people to smooth their consumption and insure themselves against economic vulnerabilities, from illness and accidents to theft and unemployment. Financial access enables poor people to save and borrow -- allowing them to build their assets, to invest in education and entrepreneurial ventures, and thus to improve their livelihoods. Inclusive finance is especially likely to benefit disadvantaged groups such as women, youth, and rural communities. For all these reasons financial inclusion has gained prominence in recent years as a policy objective to improve the lives of the poor.","2012-04-13","2021-07-01 11:32:35","2021-07-01 11:32:47","","","181","","","","","","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","GFI2011","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=beFDM9BPeTgC","","Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Business & Economics / Finance / General; Business & Economics / Reference; Nature / Reference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the almost two billion people in the world that are financially excluded, the World Bank and other stakeholders have committed to helping one billion people gain access to financial services and become involved in the formal economy by 2020.  This rapid pace of financial inclusion will bring vast amounts of income and tax revenues into the global economy that is important to understand as it creates different opportunities and challenges for developing and advanced countries that they will need to prepare for. Using various global datasets, a methodology was developed to forecast financial inclusion rates, digital payments rates, average income, and other factors up to the year 2020. The results suggest a sharp increase in financial inclusion rates and digital payment rates which translate to hundreds of millions of people entering the formal economy. Details of the most affected countries by dollar value, percent change, and the regional affects are provided for various indicators throughout the study.  With regards to capturing the most tax revenue, China and the United States gain the most in dollar terms while Turkmenistan gains the most in percentage terms. Between 2014 and 2020, a cumulative $12 trillion of income is projected to enter the formal economy worldwide resulting in $4.1 trillion in tax revenue.

Recently, it has been argued by some authors that the rise in personal remittance inflows to these countries could be leveraged for more inclusive finance. In this essay, we examine whether remittances have provided additional avenues for policymakers to promote financial inclusion. Although some case studies have explored the potential link between remittances and households’ demand for financial services, no cross-country analysis has yet been carried out for empirical tests. We use data from the World Bank Global Findex database (Demirguc-Kunt et al., The Global Findex Database 2011: measuring financial inclusion and the Fintech revolution. The World Bank, Washington, 2011) on financial inclusion for 107 remittance-receiving countries to examine whether remittances contribute to inclusive finance. Contrary to the findings from earlier case studies, our results show that remittance inflows have a significant negative impact on financial inclusion by reducing the demand for deposit accounts from formal financial institutions. However, our results are consistent with the earlier findings that remittances do not have a significant and robust impact on the demand for credit instruments from formal institutions. These results continue to hold when the data are disaggregated for the rural sector. More importantly, the partial effects of remittances are found to be non-linear across countries.","2019","2021-07-01 11:18:07","2021-07-01 11:18:23","2021-07-01 11:18:07","91-108","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","GFI2011","","","","","","Hall, Joshua C.; Harper, Sara","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach This study develops an AML/CFT compliance index using the assessment data of FATF to measure the level compliance strength of countries to measure the impact of the strength of the AML/CFT regime on the financial inclusion. Financial literacy, literacy, number of bank branches and income level of countries are used as other control variables in regression analysis, which is used to test the developed model. Findings The results suggest that the AML/CFT compliance level of a country is a significant factor in determining the level of financial inclusion. Besides, the number of bank branches for 100,000 people, literacy and financial literacy are significant factors in financial inclusion. However, the results reveal that financial literacy is significant over literacy in determining financial inclusion. Therefore, having considered the importance of the AML/CFT regime for financial inclusion, regulators are required to strengthen the AML/CFT regime and make clarity on the AML/CFT regulations. This clarity will promote the digitalization and financial inclusion over time. Practical implications Most of the studies related to financial inclusion and AML/CFT aspects are qualitative. Therefore, this is only the start of measuring the strength of an AML/CFT regime. More appropriate measures will be developed in the future based on this foundation. Originality/value This paper is an original work done by the author, which discusses the issues of digital banking and financial inclusion agenda of countries with the compliance strength of the AML/CFT regime.

Many factors hinder the access and use of financial services among the population in many part of the world. The main obstacles can broadly be characterised as follows: i) social, macroeconomic, and infrastructure features; ii) institutional weakness; iii) obstacles arising from banking activities; and iv) regulatory distortion.

The analysis with random and fixed effect specifications, provides evidence that mobile money is negatively related to financial inclusion. Only in Sub-Saharan Africa does mobile money complement formal banking services. The initial low level of financial inclusion, enabling expansion of mobile money through leapfrogging existing deficient formal banking services, is the mechanism behind the positive relationship for Sub-Saharan Africa.

Using the data of more than 100,000 individuals’ characteristics in the Global Findex database, this paper examines the links between financial inclusion, institutions, and governance using panel data analysis from Muslim and developing countries. This paper argues that strong economic governance and institutions are important elements in improving financial inclusion especially for the poor segment of the society because markets, economic activity, and transactions more generally, cannot function well in their absence. The results suggest that governance positively influences financial inclusion by increasing the number of bank accounts and saving in formal financial institutions, but negatively impacts on borrowing behavior. There are also significant differences across countries and regions in explaining financial inclusion. The study suggests that removing corruption, increasing transparent legal framework, fair judicial proceedings and good administration are essential for development and raising financial inclusiveness prospects.","2017","2021-07-01 07:44:01","2021-07-01 07:44:14","2021-07-01 07:44:01","","","","","","","The Impacts of Governance and Institution on Financial Inclusion","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","GFI2014","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3GSEGE5M\papers.html","","","Development; Financial Inclusion; Financial Markets; Governance; Institutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3061390","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the country level, we assess four types of obstacles to financial inclusion: macroeconomic weaknesses, income inequality, institutional deficiencies and financial sector inefficiencies. A key finding of this paper is that although the four types of obstacles explain the absolute level of financial inclusion, institutional deficiencies and income inequality are the most important obstacles behind the Latin America’s financial inclusion gap. From our analysis at the individual level, we find that there is a Latin America-specific effect of education and income. The results suggest that the effect of attaining secondary education on the probability of being financially included is significantly higher in Latin America than in its comparators. Furthermore, the difference in the probability of being financially included between the richest and the poorest individuals is significantly higher in Latin America than in comparator countries.","2014","2021-07-01 07:41:42","2021-07-01 07:41:53","2021-07-01 07:41:42","","","","","","SSRN Journal","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","GFI2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\5NDNMS9V\Rojas-Suarez and Amado - 2014 - Understanding Latin America's Financial Inclusion .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet cross-country, demand-side data on actual usage and preference gaps in financial services between Muslims and non-Muslims have been scarce. This paper uses novel data to explore the use of and demand for formal financial services among self-identified Muslim adults. In a sample of more than 65,000 adults from 64 economies (excluding countries where less than 1 percent or more than 99 percent of the sample self-identified as Muslim), the analysis finds that Muslims are significantly less likely than non-Muslims to own a formal account or save at a formal financial institution after controlling for other individual- and country-level characteristics. But the analysis finds no evidence that Muslims are less likely than non-Muslims to report formal or informal borrowing. Finally, in an extended survey of adults in five North African and Middle Eastern countries with relatively nascent Islamic finance industries, the study finds little use of Sharia-compliant banking products, although it does find evidence of a hypothetical preference for Sharia-compliant products among a plurality of respondents despite higher costs.","2013-10-01","2021-07-01 07:40:42","2021-07-01 07:40:56","2021-07-01 07:40:42","","","","","","","Islamic Finance and Financial Inclusion","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","GFI2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\GSBM3K8L\papers.html","","","Access to Finance; Banks & Banking Reform; Debt Markets; Emerging Markets; Islamic Finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2341370","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a cross-sectional analysis. Data were taken from Global Findex data of World Bank and Indices of social development. Data were analysed using limited information maximum likelihood to establish the relationship between usage of basic financial services and women’s land ownership status variables. The study considers different demographic, social and economic factors as control variables. Socio-economic gender equality index and land ownership status of men are considered as instrumental variables in the estimations for controlling endogeneity problem. Findings The study proves that there is a significant influence of women’s land ownership status on their demand and usage of basic financial services. The results show that women who own land alone have a significant relationship for formal account ownership and formal savings but are deprived of formal and informal credit. The results find that women are more likely to avail of formal credit when they are backed by someone else in the family especially men. Irrespective of the wealth quintile to which women belong, they are deprived of credit if they do not own any land. The findings also show that women in higher wealth quintiles are more active in availing credit. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to the extent of influence of women’s land ownership status on their demand for basic financial services. Practical implications The study recommends appropriate economic and financial policies to encourage women to own, possess and use their land for personal as well as entrepreneurial activities. The study also suggests for policies to encourage women for joint ownership of land for better credit availability.

The main focus of the thesis is on constructing a broader multidimensional measure of financial inclusion as a composite index that can be used to assess the ease of and use of the access to financial markets. Additionally, as one of the main contributions of this study, access to other financial institutions such as microfinance institutions, post offices and cooperatives, has been added to the analysis to explore its impact on poverty and Islamic finance. The International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics and Financial Access Survey databases, the World Bank’s Global Financial Development and Global Findex databases, and the survey data by Beck et al. (2006a) are used to collect the indicators of the indices. Using the broader multidimensional financial inclusion indices as a proxy of financial access, the study aims to assess the impact of financial inclusion on poverty reduction in the third chapter. In the next chapter, using the constructed financial inclusion indices as a proxy of financial exclusion, it aims to explore the impact of Islamic finance on financial exclusion to examine why our constructed financial inclusion indices are better measurements of financial access.

At the same time, a fast-growing amount of literature has emerged to examine its measurement, determinants and impacts. Governments have made the promotion of it a priority. For example, the World Bank’s 2014 Global Financial Development Report (GFDR), devoted to financial inclusion, reports that more than two-thirds of regulatory and supervisory agencies have been tasked with encouraging financial inclusion, and more than 50 countries have set formal targets. Last year, the World Bank President announced a global target of universal financial access by 2020. Defined as the share of the population who use financial services, financial inclusion has proven to be linked to desirable economic outcomes above and beyond those associated with the more familiar concept of financial depth. In this chapter, we analyse the existing country-level information on both financial inclusion and the penetration or presence of Islamic banking in order to ascertain the extent to which Islamic banking has contributed to financial inclusion. This chapter tests for a possible financial inclusion of Islamic banking relationships across a wide variety of measures. Our findings suggest a weak and tentative evidence of Islamic banking’s positive impact on some types of inclusion.

The findings show that, despite growth in the financial sector in many Muslim countries over the past few decades, many individuals and firms are still financially excluded. An analysis of the use of and access to financial services by adults and firms also shows that most Muslim countries lag behind other emerging economies in both respects, with a rate of financial inclusion of only 27%. Cost, distance, documentation, trust, and religious requirements are among the important obstacles. In addition, not surprisingly, the extent of Islamic microfinance is very limited, small by international standards; it accounts for a small proportion of microfinance, about 0.5% of global microfinance, and lacks a cost-efficient service model. This study suggests that Islamic instruments for redistributing income such as awqaf, qard-al-hassan, sadaqa, and zakah, can play a role in bringing more than 40 million people, who are financially excluded for religious reasons, into the formal financial system. The Islamic financial services industry has a long way to go in improving financial inclusion in many Muslim countries due to the scale needed and its relatively weak infrastructure.","2016-09-01","2021-07-01 05:43:10","2021-07-01 05:43:24","2021-07-01 05:43:10","303-320","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","GFI2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\WQZWIRSS\17520843.2016.html","","","financial inclusion; growth; institutions; Islamic finance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even after controlling for a host of individual characteristics including income, education, employment status, rural residency and age, gender remains significantly related to usage of financial services. This study also finds that legal discrimination against women and gender norms may explain some of the cross-country variation in access to finance for women. The analysis finds that in countries where women face legal restrictions in their ability to work, head a household, choose where to live, and receive inheritance, women are less likely to own an account, relative to men, as well as to save and borrow. The results also confirm that manifestations of gender norms, such as the level of violence against women and the incidence of early marriage for women, contribute to explaining the variation in the use of financial services between men and women, after controlling for other individual and country characteristics.","2013-04-01","2021-07-01 05:37:59","2021-07-01 05:38:09","2021-07-01 05:37:59","","","","","","","Financial Inclusion and Legal Discrimination Against Women","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","GFI2011","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\SFX7QZGE\papers.html","","","Access to Finance; Financial Literacy; Gender and Development; Gender and Law; Population Policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2254240","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last century the United States has experienced a ‘sibsize revolution’, in which sibship sizes declined, and which led to a convergence in family circumstances for children. Did this happen in other countries as well? OBJECTIVE This study examines the development of sibship size and social disparities in sibship size in low-fertility countries across the 20th century. METHODS We analyze sibship size data collected from 111 nationally representative surveys conducted in 26 low-fertility countries across the 20th century. RESULTS Average sibship sizes have declined in virtually all countries. Average sibship sizes are socially stratified, with smaller sibship sizes among higher-educated parents. This social disparity in sibship size has declined over time, indicating convergence in most countries. This convergence applies to large families, but not to only-child families. CONTRIBUTION Siblings are an understudied phenomenon in family demography, despite their growing importance in a time of increasingly complex family structures. Given the significance of sibship size for children’s educational outcomes and overall life chances, decreasing social disparities in sibship size suggest greater equality in the intergenerational transmission of advantage.","2020","2021-06-30 17:13:56","2021-06-30 17:14:21","2021-06-30 17:13:56","461-500","","","43","","","The sibsize revolution in an international context","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","GSS1992","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\5XRAELD6\Präg et al. - 2020 - The sibsize revolution in an international context.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The slow adjustment to unemployment was a result of employers using various means to maintain employment levels, including; extended periods of unpaid leave, reduced hours of work and non-payment of wages. A theoretical model presented here explains why it was rational for firms to adjust labour in this way. The nature of inherited features of the Soviet labour market and lack of institutions necessary for a competitive market economy meant it was in the firm's interest initially to maintain employment levels. Quantitative analysis using Kyrgyz data for 1993 and 1996 provides evidence of changing economic behaviour in agents over this period.","2003-05-01","2021-06-30 17:02:30","2021-06-30 17:02:43","2021-06-30 17:02:30","","","","","","","Why Labour Hoarding May Be Rational","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","KMPS1993","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\AQSSYMAH\papers.html","","","SSRN; Ceema Zahra Namazie; Why Labour Hoarding May Be Rational: A Model of Firm Behaviour During Transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 1158960","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2016, alone, over 350 million rural youth lived in conflict-affected countries. Despite conflict’s being defined as “development in reverse”, however, we find a general lack of research focusing specifically on young people living in rural areas. Yet, from wider literature, we know that conflict is a cause of adversities across a range of economic and non-economic indicators. When young people experience violence in consecutive life stages, adversities from one stage – such as weakened education – can be carried forward into subsequent life stages - such as transition to employment. In this background paper, we show that exposure to violence increases infant mortality, reduces birthweight, harms child health, damages human capital accumulation, restricts performance in education and interacts negatively with labour market opportunities. Despite this accumulated knowledge, however, we note that key knowledge gaps remain, especially when it comes to understanding the programmes that can mitigate the damage exposure to conflict causes. There is, therefore, an urgent need to understand how and why exposure to conflict harms the lives of rural youth, and perhaps more importantly, how it harms those lives differently from those of other socio-demographic groups. Given that rural youth are disproportionately affected by conflict, there is also a need for the design of, and learning from, programmes that are specifically targeted at protecting and empowering rural youth during the post-conflict phase.","2019-12-12","2021-06-30 16:46:52","2021-06-30 16:47:06","2021-06-30 16:46:52","","","","","","","IFAD Research Series 54","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","SoCo2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\GFH8GMC8\papers.html","","","employment; education; conflicts; policies; rural youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3523806","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Все они — светские государства с конституциями, сулящими свободу религии и вероисповедания и запрещающими дискриминацию по признаку религии. После получения независимости в 1991 году в них отмечались частые нарушения религиозных прав граждан, в том числе и прав мусульман. Многие из подобных нарушений совершающие их репрессивные режимы стремятся оправдать, утверждая, что участники религиозных объединений причастны к деятельности таких организаций, как ""Хизб ут-Тахрир"" (Партия исламского освобождения) и Исламское движение Узбекистана, заклейменных как террористические, или же сочувствуют таким организациям и, таким образом, могут рассматриваться как угроза сохранению политической власти этих режимов. В данной статье рассматриваются нарушения религиозных прав мусульман в Центральной Азии, совершавшиеся уже после того, как соответствующие страны отказались от марксизма-ленинизма. Она начинается с описания ситуации с религией и средствами массовой информации в регионе и обзора предшествующих исследований. В следующем разделе представлен краткий обзор мер государственного регулирования и ограничений религиозной практики исповедания ислама, в основе которого — доклады международных правозащитных организаций. Затем с помощью методов качественного контент-анализа исследуется освещение проблемы западными службами новостей, прежде всего располагающейся в Норвегии информационной службой ""Форум 18"". В заключение рассматриваются значение и последствия того факта, что западные СМИ не освещают в должной мере подобные нарушения прав, и высказываются соображения о возможных направлениях будущих исследований.","2010","2021-06-30 16:40:03","2021-06-30 16:40:22","2021-06-30 16:40:03","164-180","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cyberleninka.ru","","IRI2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\EPPBB4XS\avtoritarnye-rezhimy-religioznye-prava-musulman-v-tsentralnoy-azii-i-nedostatochnoe-osveschenie.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\P4UBKWIE\Эрик - 2010 - Авторитарные режимы, религиозные права мусульман в.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It claims that it is too early to assess the success of the ENP in this sphere especially given that the actual progress of the ENP agenda has been limited. A review of the empirical evidence on external reform anchors confirms that the ENP shares some features with the EU accession process that has proven to be an effective mechanism supporting major economic, political and social changes in the countries concerned. The eventual ENP economic offer is meaningful and integration with the EU is getting stronger public support in several CIS countries and among their political elites. On the other hand several factors limit the reform anchoring potential of the ENP. This paper offers recommendations on policies that could strengthen this potential.","2009-04-16","2021-06-30 16:39:29","2021-06-30 16:39:41","2021-06-30 16:39:29","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","IRI2007","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\9LDSCTGS\papers.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\TIALSJHI\Paczynski - 2009 - European Neighbourhood Policy and Economic Reforms.pdf","","","CIS; economic reforms; ENP; EU; political economy; reform anchoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 1373951","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evidence shows sideways concessions are effective among respondents who were dissatisfied with the government and not optimistic about the future of the country.

With specific focus on Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, it discusses trans-regional policy issues that arise from the EU’s relations with regions beyond the ENP. Based on an interdisciplinary, policy-oriented approach, this volume explores major political, legal, security and socio-economic challenges and identifies opportunities for cooperation across the EU’s broader neighbourhood.

This was underpinned by a commitment to democratic ideals and the emergence of a thriving civil society. The international community was impressed and regarded Kyrgyzstan as an exemplary model for regional development. There were many Kyrgyz, especially among the educated, urban sector of the population, who shared this positive view. Consequently, it came as a shock when, in 2010, the country was engulfed by a terrible series of violent clashes. It was tempting to seek 'instant' culprits and readily comprehensible 'causes.' The easiest solution was to present the conflict as an internecine struggle between rival ethnic communities. However, as those with long first-hand experience of the region pointed out, this explanation was too simplistic. Some commentators suggested that a 'third force' was responsible for the violence, variously identified as supporters of ex-President Bakiev, Islamist groups, criminal gangs, foreign powers -- or a combination of these elements. Such allegations may indeed have contained a grain of truth, but they were at best only partial explanations. Looking back at the country's recent history, it is clear that the conflict took place against a background of social tension, disaffection and increasingly anarchic tendencies; external factors, especially the rivalry between the United States and Russia, did not help matters. This paper argues that the events of 2010 ought not to be examined in isolation but should be set within the systemic and structural 'anatomy' of Kyrgyzstan, as well as the wider geopolitical environment. In retrospect, was the 2010 conflict a turning point that allowed the country to make a fresh start -- to address inherent problems? Or was it just another episode in a series of upheavals that shocked society, but failed to bring about real change? There are still no definitive answers to these questions. Nevertheless, it is worth revisiting the events of that year to try to identify key developments. Firstly, what were the 'conflictogenic factors' that created the preconditions for violence? Secondly, what happened -- what was the sequence of events, the role of the protagonists and the damage that resulted? Thirdly, what are the post-conflict trends within Kyrgyzstan, and how has it responded to the changing geopolitical environment -- especially the growing influence of China and other Asian states? Finally, through the prism of the conflict, it is important to try to understand the challenges that Kyrgyzstan faces today""--Publisher's web site.","2016","2021-06-30 16:22:48","2021-06-30 16:23:03","2021-06-30 16:22:45","","","","","","","Kyrgyzstan 2010","","","","","","","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","IRI2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\C9BIML2W\Akiner and Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and Silk Road Studies Program - 2016 - Kyrgyzstan 2010 conflict and context.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All are secular states with constitutions that promise freedom of religion and belief and prohibit discrimination based on religion. Since independence in 1991, there have been frequent violations of religious rights of their citizens, including those of Muslims. Many such violations are grounded in assertions by repressive regimes that religious practitioners are involved with or sympathetic to what are labeled terrorist organizations, such as Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Islamic Liberation) and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and thus are regarded as threats to the continuing political power of those regimes. This article examines violations of the religious rights of Muslims in Central Asia in the aftermath of the countries’ repudiation of Marxism-Leninism. It opens with a description of the religious and media setting in the region and a review of prior research. The next section uses international human rights reports to present an overview of regulation of and restraints on the practice of Islam. Then through qualitative content analysis, the article examines press coverage of the issue by Western news organizations, primarily the Norway-based Forum 18 News Service. Last, it discusses the implications of the failure of Western media to report adequately on such rights violations and suggests directions for future research.","2010","2021-06-30 16:19:58","2021-06-30 16:20:15","2021-06-30 16:19:58","146-158","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cyberleninka.ru","","IRI2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\RA7QWLC5\authoritarian-regimes-muslims-religious-rights-in-central-asia-and-lack-of-foreign-press-covera.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\WIU7NF4A\Eric - 2010 - Authoritarian regimes, Muslims' religious rights i.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it agrees with critics that the distorting effects of funding relations have meant that the promised ‘grassroots citizen empowerment’ has not been achieved directly through NGOs, it does not agree that NGOs are therefore merely vehicles of the Western ideological agenda and international aid to the Kyrgyzstani population. It argues that the facilitation of international actors has opened up opportunities for individual NGO activists to pursue their own social and political development agendas. In recent years, some activists have begun to use these opportunities to develop strategies through which grassroots interests are represented to decision-makers, and citizens' abilities to represent their own interests are enhanced. The strategies adopted differ from the mainstream civil society model and have allowed some NGOs to function in a manner more relevant to the specific Kyrgyzstani context. This suggests that local Kyrgyzstani NGOs and activists should not all be written off as ‘artificial’ civil society, irrelevant to the dynamics of state–society relations.","2009-03-01","2021-06-30 15:56:54","2021-06-30 15:57:05","2021-06-30 15:56:54","59-77","","1","28","","","Home-grown strategies for greater agency","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","IRI2007","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3QGPJ8HE\02634930902796422.html","","","Kyrgyzstan; democratization; citizen empowerment and representation; civil society; NGOs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the aftermath of the so-called Tulip Revolution, press rights advocates and journalists welcomed the promise of greatly enhanced freedoms. However, the new regime proved to be as authoritarian and corrupt as its predecessor and little liberalization of the press system was evident five years later. Physical assaults continued, including murders, as did harassment, libel suits, impediments to access to information, license denials and self-censorship. There was only slow movement toward privatizing of state-owned media. Independent and oppositional media also remained in financial peril due to the country’s weak economy and high poverty level. Thus, 20 years after independence and a half-decade after the Tulip Revolution, the Soviet propaganda model for a press system was dead in name, but many major attributes survived, with significant implications for the continuum of authoritarianism in other postcommunist nations. The degree to which the April 2010 coup and subsequent constitutional change to a parliamentary democracy will spur an expansion of press rights and sustain market-based independent media outlets remains speculative amid grave concerns about continuing anti-press events.","2012-04-01","2021-06-30 15:55:10","2021-06-30 15:55:20","2021-06-30 15:55:09","47-64","","1","8","","Global Media and Communication","Deepening shadows","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","IRI2009","","","","","Kyrgyzstan; ‘independent’ and oppositional media; post-Soviet media; press rights; transparency; Tulip Revolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article argues that China’s reliance on economic exchange to secure its strategic ends in Kyrgyzstan has resulted in asymmetric economic exchange between the two states. Through this asymmetric exchange, China has gained influence over Kyrgyzstan’s domestic structures. Chinese structural power, in turn, contributes to violence across Kyrgyzstan’s structures of economy, environment, and society and within the country’s state-society relations. Structural violence within Kyrgyzstan also results in periphery instability and domestic insecurity for China.

Specifically, it uses Kyrgyzstan as a case study to test the argument that environmental concerns mobilized people to engage in protest and in ways different from other kinds of protest. This essay presents the first systematic study of public opinion about the environment in Kyrgyzstan. It includes results from a 2009 nationwide survey, over 100 expert and elite interviews, and newspaper content analysis. Furthermore, it spatially analyzes these results to identify geographical variation in public perception and political event occurrence patterns. Protest engagement is a complex process determined by the interaction of several factors, and is not explained solely by affluence, rationality, or grievances. Eco-mobilization – collective political action about the environment – represents a class of protest events that offers a different view into mass discontent in the former Soviet Union and neo-patrimonial societies. The study finds that these political actions about the environment are not necessarily elite driven; there is a basic foundation of national concern and salience of these issues, and demonstrated environmental beliefs do help to explain protest behavior.","2013-07-01","2021-06-30 15:44:55","2021-06-30 15:45:47","2021-06-30 15:44:55","314-353","","4","29","","","Another way of saying enough","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","IRI2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\2P6NRYG4\1060586X.2013.html","","","Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; former Soviet Union; public opinion; environmental behavior; gold mining; protest; water resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drawdown of U.S. forces from Afghanistan provides the most important opportunity since the intervention in 2001 to craft a “smart power” strategy for the region in order to advance American interests over the medium and longer-term. An integrated approach combining the hard power of a limited military presence with the arsenal of American soft power will enable the United States to balance and compete with growing Chinese and Russian influence, and will be cost effective. Dynamic economic and political changes in the region, and the attitudes of local populations create a conducive framework for such a strategy. Given the region’s proximity to Russia and China, American efforts will have greater success if they are not couched in terms of a zero sum approach to competition, which risks stoking regional concerns. Robust American engagement in the Central Region should take into account possibilities for limited cooperation with Russia and China on issues such as countering terrorism and narcotics trafficking. For purposes of this paper, the Central Region encompasses Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. I approach these issues through the perspective of my involvement in the Central Region as the State Department’s Senior Political Adviser to the Commanders of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) from 2011 to 2016, and through my more than 30 years of diplomatic experience.","2021","2021-06-30 15:18:34","2021-06-30 15:18:46","2021-06-30 15:18:34","259-278","","","","","","Seize the Opportunity","","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","CAB2017","","","","","Central region; Great power competition; Smart power; Soft power; Strategy","Farhadi, Adib; Masys, Anthony J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the recent rise of heterosexual transmission, especially among women, there is a need to assess women’s knowledge about HIV/AIDS and its methods of prevention and transmission across two time periods to examine cross-time changes and identify areas that need improvements. Methods: Logistic regression and simulation of predicted probability analyses were based on data from Tajik women ranging in age from 15 to 49 who participated in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) study in 2000 and 2005. Results: We found that an over 2-fold increase in general knowledge about HIV/AIDS was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the ability to identify correct methods of prevention and to reject myths regarding its transmission. Conclusion: These alarming findings should prompt policy makers and program implementers to shift the focus of programs from raising general awareness to educating women about how HIV/AIDS is transmitted. Furthermore, rigorous efforts should be made to provide the most disadvantaged groups, including women of younger ages, with lower education, and from poor households with accurate information and adequate access to limited resources.","2016-12-01","2021-06-30 14:52:55","2021-06-30 14:53:12","2021-06-30 14:52:55","1075-1079","","6","26","","European Journal of Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","MICS2005","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\JCK4DBQ6\2616249.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3Y4TGBCD\Zainiddinov and Habibov - 2016 - Trends and predictors of knowledge about HIVAIDS .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The association between access to IDWS and the incidence of childhood diarrhoea (ICD) was also quantified. Information from 1.63 million households obtained through nationally representative and cross-sectional demographic and health survey (DHS) and multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) from 81 countries were analysed. Sub-national inequalities in the access to IDWS were measured using proportional variability (PV). Most studied countries with low coverage and high inequalities in accessing IDWS were from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Wealth status of households showed a higher variability in the IDWS than the variability across locations. Significant negative associations between accessing IDWS and ICD were observed for regional models, except for SSA. This study adds knowledge towards understanding the state of sustainable development goal achievements in terms of accessing IDWS. The knowledge may be helpful in designing country-specific, achievable, short- and long-term strategies.

Moreover, obtaining water may involve great expense of time and energy for those who have no water sources in or near home. From an historical perspective, with the invention of piped water, fetching water has only recently become largely irrelevant in many locales. In addition, in most instances, wells and clean surface water were so close by that fetching was not considered a problem. However, population growth, weather fluctuations and social upheavals have made the daily chore of carrying water highly problematic and a public health problem of great magnitude for many, especially women, in the poor regions and classes of the world. In this paper, we consider gender differences in water carrying and summarize data about water access and carrying from 44 countries that participated in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) program. Women and children are the most common water carriers, and they spend considerable time (many trips take more than an hour) supplying water to their households. Time is but one measure of the cost of fetching water; caloric expenditures, particularly during droughts, and other measures that affect health and quality of life must be considered. The full costs of fetching water must be considered when measuring progress toward two Millennium Development Goals – increasing access to safe drinking water and seeking an end to poverty.","2011-05-01","2021-06-30 14:01:41","2021-06-30 14:02:00","2021-06-30 14:01:41","1522-1526","","9","72","","Social Science & Medicine","Safe access to safe water in low income countries","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","MICS2005","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\N3NXNC34\S0277953611001572.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\D5K79GS2\Sorenson et al. - 2011 - Safe access to safe water in low income countries.pdf","","","Gender; Economic development; Low-income countries; Public health; Sex differences; Water; Water carrying; Women’s health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exposure to domestic violence and corporal punishment are risk factors in children's development. This study investigated how women's attitudes about domestic violence are related to attitudes about corporal punishment and harsh behaviors toward children, and whether country-wide norms regarding domestic violence and corporal punishment are related to psychological aggression and physical violence toward children. Study design Data were drawn from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, a nationally representative and internationally comparable household survey developed by the United Nations Children's Fund. Measures of domestic violence and discipline were completed by 85 999 female caregivers of children between the ages of 2 and 14 years from families in 25 low- and middle-income countries. Results Mothers who believed that husbands were justified in hitting their wives were more likely to believe that corporal punishment is necessary to rear children. Mothers who believed that husbands were justified in hitting their wives and that corporal punishment is necessary to rear children were more likely to report that their child had experienced psychological aggression and physical violence. Countrywide norms regarding the acceptability of husbands hitting wives and advisability of corporal punishment moderated the links between mothers' attitudes and their behaviors toward children. Conclusions Pediatricians can address parents' psychological aggression and physical violence toward children by discussing parents' attitudes and behaviors within a framework that incorporates social norms regarding the acceptability of domestic violence and corporal punishment.","2014-05-01","2021-06-30 13:54:01","2021-06-30 13:54:22","2021-06-30 13:54:01","1208-1213","","5","164","","The Journal of Pediatrics","Attitudes Justifying Domestic Violence Predict Endorsement of Corporal Punishment and Physical and Psychological Aggression towards Children","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","MICS2005","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\3G8BMX67\S0022347613014959.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\44I285RG\Lansford et al. - 2014 - Attitudes Justifying Domestic Violence Predict End.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hypothesis tested is whether real estate ownership is associated with greater reported life satisfaction. Findings Empirical results from the variety of empirical models estimated strongly support the hypothesis that real estate ownership is associated with greater reported life satisfaction in transition countries. Research limitations/implications Analysis is limited because life satisfaction is self-reported and specifically for residents of transition countries. Practical implications Results confirm that ownership of a home, second home or land parcel is associated with greater life satisfaction.

The results indicate that the transition shock of the early 90s had a substantial eﬀect on employment and labor market trajectories at the microeconomic level. The main results can be summarized as follows. Labor market participation decreases sharply in most countries and recovers only by 2001 onwards. The self-employment sector grows gradually as transition progresses. There is a large substitution of state for private sector employment throughout the transition. State sector employment is hit much stronger by the transition shock and private sector employment is the preferred option when people return to work for wages after a period of nonemployment or enter work force after completing their education. High-skill employment is more shock-resistant than low- or medium-skill employment; there is no evidence of an upward or downward occupational mobility. With regard to both timing and intensity of the transition shock, labor markets have been aﬀected diﬀerentially in diﬀerent regions. Even though cross-country heterogeneity of the labor market transitions is very large, some typology is observed.","","2021-07-06 11:47:14","2021-07-06 11:47:23","","210","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","LiT2006","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\WV354PNX\Denisova et al. - Labor Market Flows in Transition.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It finds satisfaction with public service delivery in Europe and Central Asia to be relatively high, and, despite the adverse economic and social impact of the recent global economic crisis, to have risen since 2006 in most countries in the region. However, the level of satisfaction with public service delivery in Eastern European and Central Asian countries in 2010 remains lower than in Western European comparator countries. Although the Life in Transition Survey does not provide specific objective measures of service delivery quality and efficiency, the data provide three important clues that may help explain why satisfaction is lower in transition countries than in western comparators: (i) relatively higher utilization of public services in Eastern European and Central Asian countries, (ii) relatively higher reported prevalence of unofficial payments, and (iii) relatively underdeveloped mechanisms for grievance redress.","2012-03-01","2021-07-06 11:46:03","2021-07-06 11:46:23","2021-07-06 11:46:03","","","","","","","Governance and Public Service Delivery in Europe and Central Asia","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiT2010","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\UW6UAW4B\papers.html","","","E-Government; Housing & Human Habitats; Population Policies; Governance Indicators; Public Sector Corruption & Anticorruption Measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 2020866","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our paper contributes to the literature by explicitly tackling this potential contradiction. Our results nuance our understanding of the role of corruption on people’s life satisfaction in Eastern Europe by investigating the extent to which the subjective cost of corruption depends on its pervasiveness. We demonstrate: (1) large individual cost associated with different measures of corruption, (2) a small reduction in these costs for some measures of corruption as it becomes more pervasive and (3) large inequalities in the cost of corruption depending on education and income.

The emphasis of the paper is on income comparisons, specifically; local comparisons and self-ranking. The main findings reveal that comparisons have a significant impact on life satisfaction in transition countries, whereas the relationship between comparison and life satisfaction is ambiguous in developed European countries. In transition countries, the impact of comparisons is asymmetric: in most cases, under-performing one’s benchmark has a greater effect than out-performing it.

Out of a total regional population of about 475 million, about 50 million have moved out of poverty over 1998-99 and 2005-06. Gender issues related to these economic outcomes have not been widely studied in the transition countries of the ECA Region though some important pieces of research have indeed been undertaken in recent years. In this paper we use the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) dataset, a joint initiative of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank, covering all the transition countries in the ECA Region. Using a multivariate regression method, we get findings in line with the literature for standard covariates, and interesting transition countries-specific results. Social capital and perceived change in social capital after the start of the transition is correlated with life satisfaction as well as preference for market economy and democracy make people happier after the transition. We also perform some sensitivity analysis which confirms general findings and unveils some country groups and gender specificities.","2008","2021-07-06 11:24:29","2021-07-06 11:24:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","LiT2006","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\TXN4I52U\Paul et al. - 2008 - Happiness in Transition Countries Preliminary vers.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\4JHFATK8\summary.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But how may these expectations be formed? Using Life in Transition survey data for a large set of transition economies and several Western European countries, this paper examines the link between beliefs about the importance of personal connections for getting access to opportunities, such as a good job or university education, and expectations of future socioeconomic mobility. The analysis of survey data finds evidencethat: (i) lack of connections is associated with expectations of a lower position on the future social ladder; and (ii) when informal connections are unavailable, it matters for your aspirations whether you perceive connections to be vital or not. There is also some evidence that in the European Union, where formal institutions are stronger, individuals are less likely to resort to informal institutions such as personal connections, even when these are available. Perceptions of unequal access to opportunities are also linked with stronger redistributive preferences. Finally, there is some evidence that unequal access to opportunities is associated not only with lower intragenerational mobility, but also with lower intergenerational mobility.","2019-02-05","2021-07-06 11:23:30","2021-07-06 11:23:42","2021-07-06 11:23:30","","","","","","","Inequality of Access to Opportunities and Socioeconomic Mobility","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","LiT2010","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\4R4AIBNY\papers.html","","","Educational Sciences; Inequality; Labor Markets; Natural Disasters; Poverty Assessment; Poverty Diagnostics; Poverty Impact Evaluation; Poverty Lines; Poverty Monitoring & Analysis; Small Area Estimation Poverty Mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ID 3335092","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estimates based on this model confirm aversion to inequality among individuals both in the pooled sample and separately among the EU and non-EU countries. The Gini index, on the other hand, is unable to capture this negative effect of inequality on well-being. Notably, inequality aversion is not intrinsic.

While poverty increased during the initial years of transition, primarily on account of the sharp economic contraction, the resurgence of economic growth in the region since 1998 has resulted in a rebound in household incomes and living standards. Data from the 2006 Life in Transition Survey (LiTS)a joint initiative of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bankprovides a unique opportunity to investigate the extent to which citizens of ECA countries are satisfied with their lives and with the performances of their governments, and to study key factors influencing their outlook in a systematic way across all countries of the region.The main objective of the LiTS was to assess the impact of transition on people, covering four main themes. First, it collected personal information on aspects of material well-being, including household expenditures, possession of consumer goods such as a car or mobile phone, and access to local public services and utilities. Second, the survey included measures of satisfaction and attitudes towards economic and political reforms as well as public service delivery. Third, the LiTS captured individual 'histories'key events and episodes that may have influenced their attitudes towards reforms, and information on family background, employment, and coping strategies. Finally, the survey also attempted to capture the extent to which crime and corruption are affecting peoples' lives, and the extent to which individuals' trust in other people and in state institutions has changed over time.","2009","2021-07-06 11:14:12","2021-07-06 11:14:23","","","112","","","","","Satisfaction with Life and Service Delivery in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","LiT2006","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=dyQZJIr4CMkC","","Business & Economics / Development / Business Development; Medical / Health Care Delivery; Political Science / Public Policy / Social Services & Welfare; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from the World Values Survey and other sources, we study various explanations of this phenomenon. First, we document that the disparity in life satisfaction between residents of transition and nontransition countries is much larger among the elderly.  Second, we find that deterioration in public goods provision, an increase in macroeconomic volatility, and a mismatch of human capital of residents educated before transition (which disproportionately affects the aged population) explain a great deal of the difference in life satisfaction between transition countries and other countries with similar income and other macroeconomic conditions. The rest of the gap is explained by the difference in the quality of the samples. As in other countries, life satisfaction in transition countries is strongly related to income; but, due to a higher nonresponse of high-income individuals in transition countries, the survey-data estimates of the recent increase in life satisfaction, driven by 10-year sustained economic growth in transition region, are biased downwards. The evidence suggests that if the region keeps growing, life satisfaction in transition countries will catch up with the ""normal"" level in the near future.","2009-06","2021-07-06 11:13:34","2021-07-06 11:13:54","2021-07-06 11:13:34","143-168","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.aeaweb.org","","LiT2016","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\P3D4TQEM\Guriev and Zhuravskaya - 2009 - (Un)happiness in Transition.pdf","","","General Welfare, Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure; Health, Education and Training, Welfare, and Poverty; Inflation, Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Money","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a large sample of firm-level data from the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS V round) across 28 transition economies, this paper examines the link between business environment reforms and firm R&D and innovation and productivity performance within a unified structural model. In this paper, we utilize a novel approach to measure business environment reforms. As a basis for constructing a business environment reforms (BER) index, we use subjective valuations of the constraints facing firms for doing businesses vis-à-vis various dimensions of the business environment. The index is calculated as a difference between the aggregated mean scores for innovator and non-innovator firms (by country and size of locality). The lower the difference, the better the business environment is in terms of providing firms with more stimulus to invest in innovations. The estimates of the structural model proved our hypothesis on the impact of business environment reforms on the relationships between R&D investments, innovation and labor productivity. We found strong support for the impact of the BER index on the intensity of R&D and innovation as well as on labor productivity. This paper supports the early findings that R&D is an important determinant of innovation and that innovation is a driver of labor productivity.

Captor firms, in high-capture economies, enjoy private advantages in terms of more protection of their own property rights and superior firm performance.

While foreign banks can contribute to reduced costs of financial intermediation which could result in increased credit availability, there is greater ambiguity about the relationship between foreign bank presence and firms’ access to credit. In this paper, we combine both disaggregate firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) as well as country-data to construct a novel and comprehensive measure capturing firms’ credit constraints as well as information verifiability for firms. Using a firm-level sample of 37,578 observations representing 60 EMDEs covering the time period 2006 to 2014, we employ an ordered probit model on cross-sectional data to understand empirically how foreign banks affect firms’ access to credit.

A society that is more corrupt may enable more tax evasion as corrupt officials seek more income via bribes; conversely, higher levels of tax evasion may drive corruption by offering more opportunities for bribes. While a large body of work on each subject separately has emerged, the relationship between the two problems has remained a largely unexplored area. This paper focuses on how the potential for bribery of tax officials affects a firm's tax evasion decisions. To test how the potential for bribery affects a firm's tax reporting decisions, we use firm-level information on reporting obtained from the World Enterprise Survey and the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey. Our basic estimation approach uses instrumental variables methods to control for the potential endogeneity of evasion and corruption. We also use propensity score matching methods as a robustness check. Our results show that it is corruption that largely drives higher levels of evasion; that is, corruption of tax officials is a statistically and economically significant determinant of tax evasion. The presence of tax inspectors who request bribes results in a reduction of sales reported for taxes of between 4 and 10 percentage points. Additionally, larger bribes result in higher levels of evasion. Overall these results indicate that governments seeking to decrease tax evasion – and so increase tax revenues – must work first to ensure an honest tax administration.","2016-04-01","2021-07-06 08:19:42","2021-07-06 08:19:54","2021-07-06 08:19:42","146-163","","","124","","Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","","Taxation, Social Norms and Compliance","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","ES2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\IF5RECZU\S0167268115002735.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\DAG7VENG\Alm et al. - 2016 - Corruption and firm tax evasion.pdf","","","Corruption; Bribery; Tax compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That is to say, if females had the same objective individual characteristics than men, they would be even happier that what they currently are.

Using the Gallup World Poll data for 114 countries during 2009–2011, we find that having family members abroad is associated with greater evaluative well-being and positive affect, and receiving remittances is linked with further increases in evaluative well-being, especially in poorer contexts—both across and within countries. We also document that having household members abroad is linked with increased stress and depression, which are not offset by remittances. The out-migration of family members appears less traumatic in countries where migration is more common, indicating that people in such contexts might be able to cope better with separation. Overall, subjective well-being measures, which reflect both material and non-material aspects of life, furnish additional insights and a wellrounded picture of the consequences of emigration on migrant family members staying behind relative to standard outcomes employed in the literature, such as the leftbehind’s consumption, income, or labor market outcomes.","2019-01","2021-07-05 17:06:27","2021-07-05 17:06:35","2021-07-05 17:06:27","113-151","","1","32","","J Popul Econ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","GWP2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\SYALR3QN\s00148-018-0718-8.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulations Versus Self-Reporting","","","","","http://dspace.wunu.edu.ua//handle/316497/31545","FAO, USDA and World Bank estimates of the welfare impact of the 2007/2008 global food crisis conclude that between 75 and 160 million people were thrown into hunger or poverty. However, these  simulation-based approaches suffer from inherent deficiencies as well as insufficient coverage of the largest developing countries, especially China and  India. This paper therefore   assesses the usefulness of an alternative to simulation-based approaches, self-  reported food insecurity data from the Gallup World Poll (GWP), a survey conducted before, during and after the 2008 crisis. While these data are still less   than ideal, we show that trends in self-reported food insecurity are statistically   explained by both food inflation (positively) and economic growth (negatively).   This validation motivates us to employ the GWP data as a barometer for the wel-  fare impacts of the global food crisis. Our findings suggest that while there was   tremendous variation in trends across countries, global self-reported food inse-  curity fell from 2005 to 2008, with the most plausible lower and upper bound es-  timates ranging from 60 to 250 million fewer food insecure people. These results   are clearly driven by rapid economic growth and very limited food price inflation   in the world’s most populous countries, particularly China and India. Hence, self-  reported indicators of food insecurity reveal an opposite trend to simulation-  based approaches.","2012","2021-07-05 17:01:53","2021-07-05 17:02:08","2021-07-05 17:01:53","","","","","","","Was the Global Food Crisis Really a Crisis?","","","","","","","","","","","","dspace.wunu.edu.ua","","GWP2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\K3HS2DY6\Headey - 2012 - Was the Global Food Crisis Really a Crisis Simula.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\XMZL8XNM\31545.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corruption and inequality wreak havoc with the moral sense. Where corruption is widespread, people realise that they are not the masters of their own fate – and they lose faith that their future will be bright. The chapter examines how corruption and inequality affect generalised trust and confidence in government. It focuses on perceptions of corruption but objective measures of inequality are used. The Gallup World Poll is the most comprehensive cross-national survey project. It covers a wide range of countries through either face-to-face or telephone interviews. The World Poll has several measures of petty corruption: paying bribes for medical services, to the police, to avoid taxes, to get government contracts, to obtain an apartment, or to gain admission to university or to a school for the child.","2019","2021-07-05 17:00:49","2021-07-05 17:01:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","GWP2013","","","","","","Uslaner, Eric M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These provide measures of public awareness, perceived risk, and perceived human cause of climate change among general publics in over 100 countries. Three measures of fossil fuel dependence are examined: carbon dioxide emissions per capita, fossil fuel production dependence, and fossil fuel consumption dependence. The measure “carbon emissions per capita” is negatively associated with perceived risk and perceived human cause of climate change, but it is not associated with public awareness. However, when separately examining the production and consumption dimensions of fossil fuel dependence, the results indicate that greater dependence on fossil fuel production is significantly associated with lower public awareness, perceived risk, and perceived human cause of climate change; meanwhile, dependence on fossil fuel consumption has no significant effect on these three measures. These findings suggest that fossil fuel dependence, particularly dependence on the production of fossil fuels, shapes public understanding, skepticism, and risk perception of climate change and may do so mainly via economic interests and efforts to defend them.","2018-10-02","2021-07-05 16:59:41","2021-07-05 16:59:55","2021-07-05 16:59:40","295-313","","4","48","","","Does Fossil Fuel Dependence Influence Public Awareness and Perception of Climate Change?","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","GWP2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\PYZ3YX9P\00207659.2018.html","","","public opinion; climate change; cross-national; fossil fuels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three aspects of psychological wellbeing can be distinguished: evaluative wellbeing (or life satisfaction), hedonic wellbeing (feelings of happiness, sadness, etc), and eudemonic wellbeing (sense of purpose and meaning in life). We review recent advances in this field, and present new analyses concerning the pattern of wellbeing across ages and the association between wellbeing and survival at older ages. The Gallup World Poll, an ongoing survey in more than 160 countries, shows a U-shaped relationship between evaluative wellbeing and age in rich, English speaking countries, with the lowest levels of wellbeing around ages 45-54. But this pattern is not universal: for example, respondents from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe show a large progressive decline in wellbeing with age; Latin America also shows falling wellbeing with age, while wellbeing in sub-Saharan Africa shows little change with age. The relationship between physical health and subjective wellbeing is bidirectional. Older people suffering from illnesses such as coronary heart disease, arthritis and chronic lung disease show both raised levels of depressed mood and impaired hedonic and eudemonic wellbeing. Wellbeing may also have a protective role in health maintenance. In an illustrative analyses from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we find that eudemonic wellbeing is associated with longer survival; 29.3% of people in the lowest wellbeing quartile died over the average follow-up period of 8.5 years compared with 9.3% of those in the highest quartile. Associations were independent of age, gender, demographic factors, and baseline mental and physical health. We conclude that the wellbeing of the elderly is an important objective for both economic and health policy. Current psychological and economic theories do not adequately account for the variations in pattern of wellbeing with age across different parts of the world. The apparent association between wellbeing and survival is consistent with a protective role of high wellbeing, but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out at this stage.","2015-02-14","2021-07-05 16:40:32","2021-07-05 16:40:46","2021-07-05 16:40:32","640-648","","9968","385","","Lancet","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","GWP2009","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\UNJ2D5BD\Steptoe et al. - 2015 - Psychological wellbeing, health and ageing.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4339610/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until very recently, scholars using various datasets have shown that residents of post-communist countries were significantly less satisfied with their lives than their counterparts in non-transition countries (controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics). The literature has explained this finding by the great macroeconomic instability of the 1990s, by a substantial decrease in the quality and accessibility of public goods, by the major increase in inequality, and by the rapid depreciation of pre-transition human capital. All these factors were expected to subside over time – at least after the post-Great-Recession recovery. In this paper, we consider two most recent datasets – the third wave of the Life in Transition Survey (administered in 2015–16) and the 2010–2016 waves of the annual Gallup World Poll. We find that by 2016 the transition happiness gap had closed. This convergence has taken place both due to a “happiness recovery” in post-communist countries after the Great Recession and due to a decrease in life satisfaction in comparator countries in recent years. We also find that the convergence in life satisfaction was primarily driven by middle-income young, educated individuals, regardless of gender.","2018-09-01","2021-07-05 16:34:04","2021-07-05 16:34:23","2021-07-05 16:34:04","683-707","","3","46","","Journal of Comparative Economics","","Wellbeing in Post-Socialist Countries","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","GWP2013","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\68Z2KTVH\Guriev and Melnikov - 2018 - Happiness convergence in transition countries.pdf; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\HRRCP9SA\S0147596718302373.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Making use of the 1998-2001 Kyrgyz Household Budget Survey, we show that when the hypothesis of decreasing return to scale holds, the relation between the threshold value of revenue per hectare and the amount of land cultivated is positive. In addition to that, the relation between the threshold and the amount of land owned is positive in the case of continuous supply of land and negative when there is discontinuous supply of land. The direct consequence is that, in the first case, smaller farms will be more willing to rent land and exercise the option where, in the second case, larger farms will exercise first. The results corroborate the findings of the theoretical model and suggest three main conclusions: (i) the combination of uncertainty and irreversibility is a significant factor in the land development decisions, (ii) farmers’ behaviour is consistent with the continuous profit maximization model, (iii) farming unit revenue tends to be positively related to farm size, once uncertainty is properly accounted for.","2009-08-20","2021-07-05 15:28:37","2021-07-05 15:28:52","2021-07-05 15:28:37","","","","","","","Optimal Farm Size under an Uncertain Land Market","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","HBS2001","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\UYFH8DRD\52844.html; C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\F4FV7FJS\Scandizzo and Savastano - 2009 - Optimal Farm Size under an Uncertain Land Market .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to reassess measures of poverty in 11 low-to-middle income countries in Asia by calculating total household resources both with and without out-of-pocket payments for health care. Methods We obtained data on payments for health care from nationally representative surveys, and subtracted these payments from total household resources. We then calculated the number of individuals with less than the internationally accepted threshold of absolute poverty (US$1 per head per day) after making health payments. We also assessed the effect of health-care payments on the poverty gap—the amount by which household resources fell short of the $1 poverty line in these countries. Findings Our estimate of the overall prevalence of absolute poverty in these countries was 14% higher than conventional estimates that do not take account of out-of-pocket payments for health care. We calculated that an additional 2·7% of the population under study (78 million people) ended up with less than $1 per day after they had paid for health care. In Bangladesh, China, India, Nepal, and Vietnam, where more than 60% of health-care costs are paid out-of-pocket by households, our estimates of poverty were much higher than conventional figures, ranging from an additional 1·2% of the population in Vietnam to 3·8% in Bangladesh. Interpretation Out-of-pocket health payments exacerbate poverty. Policies to reduce the number of Asians living on less than $1 per day need to include measures to reduce such payments.","2006-10-14","2021-07-05 15:27:50","2021-07-05 15:28:24","2021-07-05 15:27:50","1357-1364","","9544","368","","The Lancet","Effect of payments for health care on poverty estimates in 11 countries in Asia","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","HBS2001","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\M38JVHRA\S0140673606695603.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing countries and the international community are scaling up health systems to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are improving financial protection by securing long-term support for these gains. Yet money alone cannot buy health gains or prevent impoverishment due to catastrophic medical bills; well structured, results-based financing reforms are needed. Unfortunately, global evidence of ""successful"" health financing policies that can guide the reform effort is very limited and therefore the policy debate is often driven by ideological, one-size-fits-all solutions. Good Practices in Health Financing: Lessons from Reforms in Low- and Middle-Income Countries attempts to begin to fill the void by systematically assessing health financing reforms in nine low- and middle-income countries that have managed to expand their health financing systems to both improve health status and protect against catastrophic medical expenses. The participating countries are: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Estonia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tunisia, and Vietnam. The study seeks to identify common enabling factors of their good performance. While the findings for each country are important, collectively they send a clear message to the global community that more attention is needed to define ""good practice"" and then to evaluate and disseminate the global evidence base.","2008-01-01","2021-07-05 15:15:01","2021-07-05 15:15:14","","","530","","","","","Good Practices in Health Financing","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","HBS2001","","","https://books.google.kg/books?id=o_vHPjPIN08C","","Medical / Health Care Delivery; Medical / Health Policy; Medical / Practice Management & Reimbursement; Medical / Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, using benchmarks from the OECD area we review evidence from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union during the socialist period. Second, we look at the transitions currently being made by the latter. In each case we review available data and the problems they present before considering in turn: (i) the distribution of earnings of full-time employees; (ii) the distribution of individuals' per capita household incomes; and (iii) the ways in which the picture is altered by nonwage benefits from work, price subsidies and social incomes in kind. For the socialist period we are able to consider long series of data, often covering several decades, and we can thus show the changes in the picture of distribution under the socialist system. We also emphasise the diversity across the countries concerned. For the period of transition, itself incomplete, the series are inevitably shorter but we are able to avoid basing conclusions on evidence drawn from single years. The picture during transition, like that under socialism, is varied. Russia has experienced very sharp increases in measured inequality to well above the top of the OECD range. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland have seen more modest rises. We note the lack of a satisfactory analytic framework in the literature that encompasses enough features of the transition, a framework which would help interpretation of the evidence.","2000-01-01","2021-07-05 15:11:23","2021-07-05 15:11:59","2021-07-05 15:11:23","843-918","","","1","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","HBS1996","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\WMLRIZUL\S1574005600800172.html","","","Central and Eastern Europe; D31; economic systems; P2; P5; Transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet catastrophic expenditure is not rare. We investigated the extent of catastrophic health expenditure as a first step to developing appropriate policy responses. Methods We used a cross-country analysis design. Data from household surveys in 59 countries were used to explore, by regression analysis, variables associated with catastrophic health expenditure. We defined expenditure as being catastrophic if a household's financial contributions to the health system exceed 40% of income remaining after subsistence needs have been met. Findings The proportion of households facing catastrophic payments from out-of-pocket health expenses varied widely between countries. Catastrophic spending rates were highest in some countries in transition, and in certain Latin American countries. Three key preconditions for catastrophic payments were identified: the availability of health services requiring payment, low capacity to pay, and the lack of prepayment or health insurance. Interpretation People, particularly in poor households, can be protected from catastrophic health expenditures by reducing a health system's reliance on out-of-pocket payments and providing more financial risk protection. Increase in the availability of health services is critical to improving health in poor countries, but this approach could raise the proportion of households facing catastrophic expenditure; risk protection policies would be especially important in this situation.","2003-07-12","2021-07-05 15:05:53","2021-07-05 15:06:09","2021-07-05 15:05:53","111-117","","9378","362","","The Lancet","Household catastrophic health expenditure","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","PMS1998","","C:\Users\Ilias\Zotero\storage\934MBG43\S0140673603138615.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
